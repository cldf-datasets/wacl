Although some Aaris do live down in the lowlands, the majority inhabit the plateau and scarplands of the lofty southwest spur of the Gemu-Gofa highlands within the administrative territory of the Bako-Gazar warada. According to Haberland (p.420 in Jensen 1959), the Aari comprise ten tribes, known as Bako, Kure, Shangama, Bio, Sido, Argenne, Ubamer, Bargedda, Galila and 1Gossa, with a total population of less than 20,000. Although the high-land Aari cultivate some wheat and barley and keep many sheep, their staple foodstuff is {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextasciitilden8at, but from the lack of sophistication shown in their preparation of the latter, Haberland infers that for the Aari an {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextasciitilden8at - based culture is an adopted one (ibid., 421). Those Aari who inhabit the scarplands grow maize and sorghum varieties and keep small herds and flocks.},

As such, the analysis is based on very limited exposure to the language for the linguistically trained staff, and very little exposure to linguistics on behalf of the mother-tongue speakers, and thus must be considered only an initial and very tentative exploration of linguistic features.},

	type = {{PhD} {Thesis}},
	title = {Studies in the grammar of {Abbey}.},
	abstract = {This dissertation characterizes major aspects of the grammar of Abbey (a Kwa language the Ivory Coast), namely, Phonology, Morphology and Syntax. Following the introductory chapter that defines the aims and the theoretical model that governs the study, Chapter I presents a segmental phonology of Abbey. Within Stanley's (1967) framework, an examination of the morpheme structure conditions for lexical and grammatical morphemes, phonological rules, and an overview of Abbey tonology is undertaken. The chapter argues that it is futile to posit nasalized vowels as systematic phonemic segments in Abbey, and that contour tones are best represented as composite level tones rather than unitary tonal elements. Chapter II qualifies Halle's (1973) three-component Morphological model. Furthermore, the chapter discusses four word-formation rules, namely, compound-noun formation, "gerunds," agent-nouns, and reduplication. It is argued that a transformational account of "gerund" nominals cannot be sustained outside Serial Verb Constructions. A lexicalist approach which supplies each entry of the Morpheme List with paradigmatic and syntagmatic information makes a superior account of "gerunds" formation in Abbey. Agent-noun formation and morpheme root reduplication, respectively, qualifies the proposal that word-formation rules should have access to the Dictionary and that reduplication rules are integral parts of Abbey word formation rules rather than part of phonological rules. Chapter III in examines Serial Verb Constructions (SVCs) in Abbey. The constructions are a surface sentence containing two or more verbs without any connective element between them. Eddy dj\_ dzuma lo si Eddy did work gave father "Eddy worked for hh father" The most controversial aspects of the verbal constructions are the characterization of the nature of its major constituents and its syntactic source. Transformational analysis of the verbal construction is made possible by deletion under identity (Equi-NP deletion), coordinate reduction, and movement rules. In light of a critical review of the literature on SVCs in African languages, the study argues that a transformational derivation of verb serialization from underlying multiple sentences (coordinate and embedded sentences) is not motivated in African languages in general and Abbey in particular. A non-transformational approach based on a rewriting rule that allows a single simple sentence with a complex predicate (directly dominated by the [S] node) makes a better and simpler account of the phenomenon. Chapter IV summarizes each chapter of die study and presents son is concluding observations.},

The speakers of Ayta Abenlen are located in the mountainous western part of the Tarlac province of Luzon, the area probably reaching into Sambales even on the western side of the Sambales mountains. There are about 6,000 speakers of the language. Data were collected since April 1989, first in Kayawedan, Labney, Mayantoc, Tarlac; and since May of 1993 in Tangantangan, Maamot, San Jose, Tarlac. The data include elicited sentences and paradigms, a 1,000-entry dictionary and about 10 stories as natural text. I would like to thank all the people from the Ayta Abenlen language group who helped with the collection of data.},

It is the first of its kind on this community. In brief, chapter 1 gives a summary of the thesis, followed by a more detailed description of the Abu' language area and its dialects, as seen from a linguist's point of view, in chapter 2. This and Chapter ʒ, which gives an over sew of the grammar and phonology of Abu' , provide the general background knowledge of the nature of the language as a basis for the discussions on sociolinguistic aspects of Abu' in chapters 4 to 7. In chapter 4, the Abu' world-view is examined showing the relatively influential role it has on the determination of noun classes. This is followed in chapter 5, by a description of speaker's speech repertoire. This focusses on the pattern of verbal behaviour among different social groups. In chapter 6, non-verbal means of communication (excluding gestural communication) is treated. Chapter 7 examines language attitudes and use among the Abu .},

The study performs analysis on the structure and functions of Asheron phrases and clauses. It aims to set out rules and patters of the language from a syntactic point of view. It also tries to provide a foundation for further research in the language. The study falls into five chapters. Ch.1 is an introductory chapter which includes classification and historical background about the language. Ch.2 is a reviewof literature and linguistics background. Ch. 3 deals with the analysis of phrases. It also includes description of different word classes that found in Asheron language as well as the word order. Ch. 4 centers on the analysis of the structure of the clauses in the language. Ch. 5 summarizes the study and presents the conclusions and findings.},

	title = {A grammar of {Chácobo}, a southern {Pano} language of the northern {Bolivian} {Amazon}},
	url = {https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/74212},
	doi = {10.26153/TSW/1343},
	abstract = {This dissertation provides a description of the Chácobo language, a southern Pano language spoken by approximately 1200 people who live close to or on the Geneshuaya, Ivon, Benicito and Yata rivers in the northern Bolivian Amazon. The grammatical description emerges out of an ethnographically based documentation project of the language. Chapter 1 contains an overview of the cultural context in which the Chácobo language is embedded and a brief ethnohistory of the Chácobo people. I also discuss the general methodology of the dissertation touching specifically on issues related to data collection. Chapter 2 introduces the phonology of the language focusing on the categories necessary for its description. Chapter 3 provides a discussion of morphosyntactic structures and relations. This chapter provides a discussion of how head-dependent relations and the general distinction between morphology and syntax are understood throughout the dissertation. Parts of speech classes (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs) are also defined and motivated based on semantic and formal criteria. Chapter 4 describes predication and its relationship to clause-typing. Chapter 5 is concerned with constituency which refers to hierarchical structures motivated through distributional properties and relations and the relative degree of contiguity between linguistic categories. Chapter 6 provides an extensive discussion of morphophonology and its relation to constituency. Chapter 7 and 8 are concerned with the language’s alignment and valence-adjusting systems. The next five chapters provide a description of the functional domains relevant to the verbal domain including; Tense (Chapter 9); Temporal distance (Chapter 10); Aspect (Chapter 11); Associated Motion (Chapter 12); Perspective (Chapter 13). The last two Chapters focus on categories in the nominal domain. Chapter 14 provides a description of noun compounding, adjectives and possession. Chapter 15 provides a description of number, quantification and deixis inside and outside the nominal domain.},

	abstract = {本文指出漢語個體量詞和非個體量詞雖然在語意屬性上有所差異，在詞類劃分上卻都是量詞，而不是經由名詞的移位而轉換過來的；相對的，英語中所謂的「度量詞」則仍屬名詞。這種非移位的語意屬性分析除了可以有系統的詮釋不同語言間的「持續詞」的可數性以及數詞與複數詞的共存限制，還可以避免Cheng \& Sybesma（1998, 1999）和Li（1999）等相關分析的語言事實和語言類型的問題。It is shown in this paper that in Chinese sortal and mensural classifiers differ from one another in their semantic-not categorial-feature, both being listed as Cl in the lexicon and none undergoing the syntactic operation of N-to-Cl movement. In English, by contrast, the so-called measure words are categorized as N, and not Cl. This feature and non-movement analysis of classifiers may explain in a principled way the cross-linguistic variation in the mass-count property of duration expressions, on the one hand, and the cross-linguistic co-occurrence restriction between numerals and plural morphology, on the other. Such an account is also free of some empirical and typological problems raised for Cheng \& Sybesma's (1998, 1999) theory of Chinese classifiers and Li's (1999) theory of Chinese plural morphology.},

Pendau belongs to the Tomini-Tolitoli subgroup, and this book is the first comprehensive description of any of these languages. The Tomini-Tolitoli languages are of interest to typologists in general and more specifically to Austronesianists, since the languages appear to be transitional between better known Philippine style languages and Indonesian style languages. Intricate rules of vowel harmony in the prefixes used to form verb stems are of particular interest. The grammar is very richly exemplified and covers a wide range of linguistic phenomena from phonetics and phonology through to cohesion and prominence in discourse as well as an analysis of the discourse structure of a number of different genres."–Provided by publisher},

	abstract = {Standard Tajik, or Modern Literary Tajik as it was called during the Soviet era, was established in the nineteen twenties and thirties based largely on the dialects of the Bukhara-Samarkand area, which was at the time the undisputed cultural centre of the Tajik-speaking population. Dushanbe, the current capital of Tajikistan, was then a small village with a population of only a few hundred and had no cultural heritage comparable to that of Bukhara or Samarkand. Bukharan Tajik, whose phonology is described in this paper, is a variety of Tajik that played a particularly influential role in the phonological standardization of Tajik, which took place for the most part in 1930. For instance, the Scientific Conference of Uzbekistan Tajiks of 1930 resolved that the dialect of Bukhara must be the designated basis of the sound and orthography of literary Tajik (вaroji tajjorī вa kanfiransijaji ilmiji istalinoвod 1930: 2). In August the same year, the Linguistic Conference held in the then newly established Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic also adopted a similar resolution that establishes the ‘language of the Tajiks of Samarkand and Bukhara’ as the reference point in establishing the literary (i.e. standard) pronunciation (Halimov 1974: 126). According to Bergne (2007: 82), ‘the same Linguistic Conference of 22 August 1930 in Stalinabad decided that the phonetic base for the language had better be the dialect of Bukhara’. Thus, the Bukharan Tajik of today is the direct descendant of the variety of Tajik which served as a primary basis of standard Tajik phonological norms; and hence differs little from standard Tajik phonologically and phonetically.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study is to analyse the system of Kam noun classifiers in synchronical typological and diachronical pan-Kam-Tai perspective. While Kam is at the center stage of this investigation, additional data are presented from a survey of 22 Kam-Tai languages which belong to four nationalities in the P.R. of China: the Dong, Bouyei, Shui and Zhuang nationalities. The main morphosyntax function of these Chinese Kam-Tai languages is to occur in quantificational constructions (numeral and quantifier) and in referential expressions (indefiniteness, demonstrative pronouns and nominalization). Classifiers in Chinese Kam-Tai languages appear in pre-nominal position and stand in constrast to classifiers of the Kam-Tai languages located in Burma, Thailand and Vietnam which typically project the classifier into post-nominal position. Concerning the semantics of classifier systems, the Chinese Kam-Tai languages involve animacy as primary parameter, dimensionality (shape) as secondary parameter, and functionality (or instrumentality) as tertiary parameter. The sound structure of a number of core-classifiers displays a surprisingly homogenous picture across the range of Kam-Tai languages surveyed.本文研究的目的是对侗语名量词在现时类型学方面和全壮侗语系历史性方面进行了分析。侗语是本文研究的重点，除此之外还增加了新的研究数据，这些新数据是来自22个壮侗语系语言的调查，这些壮侗语系的语言属于中国四个少数民族，即：侗族、布依族、水族和壮族。这些中国壮侗语言的主要语素句法的功能是表现在数量结构和引导结构（不定概念、指示代词和名物化）。中国壮侗语言的量词是位于每个名词前；不同于缅甸、泰国和越南的壮侗语言，后者的量词是位于每个名词后。量词体系的语义在中国壮侗语言中以三种参数构成：第一是有生命参数、第二是有型参数，第三是功能参数。在我所调查的中国壮侗语言中，一些中心量词的语音结构有比较相同的发音。},

	abstract = {[Polynesian and Micronesian languages inherited a decimal number system from Proto-Oceanic, and individually extended it on one or more dimensions: in length by adding terms for larger numbers, in breadth by specifying numeral classifiers for certain objects (prevailing in Micronesia), and in factor by introducing a larger counting unit (prevailing in Polynesia). Specific counting systems are characterized by a combination of these features: They are based on larger counting units (multiplication function) and apply to certain objects only (object specificity). This paper surveys the distribution of each extension type in Polynesian and Micronesian number systems, characterizes the features that they share, and analyzes the constitutive role that numeral classifiers play for specific counting systems. It is concluded that in most of these languages, number systems are composed according to similar principles, while the divergence in classifiers, objects of reference, and factors chosen results from cultural adaptations, some of which might have been responses to socioeconomic requirements and served purposes of cognitive facilitation.]},

According to Haberland (p.420 in Jensen 1959), the Aari comprise ten tribes, known as Bako, Kure, Shangama, Bio, Sido, Argenne, Ubamer, Bargedda, Galila and 1Gossa, with a total population of less than 20,000. Although the high-land Aari cultivate some wheat and barley and keep many sheep, their staple foodstuff is {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextasciitilden8at, but from the lack of sophistication shown in their preparation of the latter, Haberland infers that for the Aari an {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextasciitilden8at - based culture is an adopted one (ibid., 421).

As such, the analysis is based on very limited exposure to the language for the linguistically trained staff, and very little exposure to linguistics on behalf of the mother-tongue speakers, and thus must be considered only an initial and very tentative exploration of linguistic features.},

	type = {{PhD} {Thesis}},
	title = {Studies in the grammar of {Abbey}.},
	abstract = {This dissertation characterizes major aspects of the grammar of Abbey (a Kwa language the Ivory Coast), namely, Phonology, Morphology and Syntax. Following the introductory chapter that defines the aims and the theoretical model that governs the study, Chapter I presents a segmental phonology of Abbey. Within Stanley's (1967) framework, an examination of the morpheme structure conditions for lexical and grammatical morphemes, phonological rules, and an overview of Abbey tonology is undertaken. The chapter argues that it is futile to posit nasalized vowels as systematic phonemic segments in Abbey, and that contour tones are best represented as composite level tones rather than unitary tonal elements. Chapter II qualifies Halle's (1973) three-component Morphological model. Furthermore, the chapter discusses four word-formation rules, namely, compound-noun formation, "gerunds," agent-nouns, and reduplication. It is argued that a transformational account of "gerund" nominals cannot be sustained outside Serial Verb Constructions. A lexicalist approach which supplies each entry of the Morpheme List with paradigmatic and syntagmatic information makes a superior account of "gerunds" formation in Abbey. Agent-noun formation and morpheme root reduplication, respectively, qualifies the proposal that word-formation rules should have access to the Dictionary and that reduplication rules are integral parts of Abbey word formation rules rather than part of phonological rules. Chapter III in examines Serial Verb Constructions (SVCs) in Abbey. The constructions are a surface sentence containing two or more verbs without any connective element between them. Eddy dj\_ dzuma lo si Eddy did work gave father "Eddy worked for hh father" The most controversial aspects of the verbal constructions are the characterization of the nature of its major constituents and its syntactic source. Transformational analysis of the verbal construction is made possible by deletion under identity (Equi-NP deletion), coordinate reduction, and movement rules. In light of a critical review of the literature on SVCs in African languages, the study argues that a transformational derivation of verb serialization from underlying multiple sentences (coordinate and embedded sentences) is not motivated in African languages in general and Abbey in particular. A non-transformational approach based on a rewriting rule that allows a single simple sentence with a complex predicate (directly dominated by the [S] node) makes a better and simpler account of the phenomenon. Chapter IV summarizes each chapter of die study and presents son is concluding observations.},

It is the first of its kind on this community. In brief, chapter 1 gives a summary of the thesis, followed by a more detailed description of the Abu' language area and its dialects, as seen from a linguist's point of view, in chapter 2. This and Chapter ʒ, which gives an over sew of the grammar and phonology of Abu' , provide the general background knowledge of the nature of the language as a basis for the discussions on sociolinguistic aspects of Abu' in chapters 4 to 7. In chapter 4, the Abu' world-view is examined showing the relatively influential role it has on the determination of noun classes. This is followed in chapter 5, by a description of speaker's speech repertoire. This focusses on the pattern of verbal behaviour among different social groups. In chapter 6, non-verbal means of communication (excluding gestural communication) is treated. Chapter 7 examines language attitudes and use among the Abu .},

This authoritative reference source provides a unique description of the languages, covering their grammatical structure and historical development, plus sociolinguistic features. Each chapter combines modern linguistic perspective with traditional historical linguistics, and a uniform structure allows for easy typological comparison between the individual languages. New to this edition are chapters on Beṭṭa Kur̲umba, Kuṛux, Kūvi and Malayāḷam, enlarged sections in various existing chapters, as well updated bibliographies and demographic data throughout. The Dravidian Languages will be invaluable to students and researchers within linguistics, and will also be of interest to readers in the fields of comparative literature, areal linguistics and South Asian studies"–},

	abstract = {本文指出漢語個體量詞和非個體量詞雖然在語意屬性上有所差異，在詞類劃分上卻都是量詞，而不是經由名詞的移位而轉換過來的；相對的，英語中所謂的「度量詞」則仍屬名詞。這種非移位的語意屬性分析除了可以有系統的詮釋不同語言間的「持續詞」的可數性以及數詞與複數詞的共存限制，還可以避免Cheng \& Sybesma（1998, 1999）和Li（1999）等相關分析的語言事實和語言類型的問題。It is shown in this paper that in Chinese sortal and mensural classifiers differ from one another in their semantic-not categorial-feature, both being listed as Cl in the lexicon and none undergoing the syntactic operation of N-to-Cl movement. In English, by contrast, the so-called measure words are categorized as N, and not Cl. This feature and non-movement analysis of classifiers may explain in a principled way the cross-linguistic variation in the mass-count property of duration expressions, on the one hand, and the cross-linguistic co-occurrence restriction between numerals and plural morphology, on the other. Such an account is also free of some empirical and typological problems raised for Cheng \& Sybesma's (1998, 1999) theory of Chinese classifiers and Li's (1999) theory of Chinese plural morphology.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study is to analyse the system of Kam noun classifiers in synchronical typological and diachronical pan-Kam-Tai perspective. While Kam is at the center stage of this investigation, additional data are presented from a survey of 22 Kam-Tai languages which belong to four nationalities in the P.R. of China: the Dong, Bouyei, Shui and Zhuang nationalities. The main morphosyntax function of these Chinese Kam-Tai languages is to occur in quantificational constructions (numeral and quantifier) and in referential expressions (indefiniteness, demonstrative pronouns and nominalization). Classifiers in Chinese Kam-Tai languages appear in pre-nominal position and stand in constrast to classifiers of the Kam-Tai languages located in Burma, Thailand and Vietnam which typically project the classifier into post-nominal position. Concerning the semantics of classifier systems, the Chinese Kam-Tai languages involve animacy as primary parameter, dimensionality (shape) as secondary parameter, and functionality (or instrumentality) as tertiary parameter. The sound structure of a number of core-classifiers displays a surprisingly homogenous picture across the range of Kam-Tai languages surveyed.本文研究的目的是对侗语名量词在现时类型学方面和全壮侗语系历史性方面进行了分析。侗语是本文研究的重点，除此之外还增加了新的研究数据，这些新数据是来自22个壮侗语系语言的调查，这些壮侗语系的语言属于中国四个少数民族，即：侗族、布依族、水族和壮族。这些中国壮侗语言的主要语素句法的功能是表现在数量结构和引导结构（不定概念、指示代词和名物化）。中国壮侗语言的量词是位于每个名词前；不同于缅甸、泰国和越南的壮侗语言，后者的量词是位于每个名词后。量词体系的语义在中国壮侗语言中以三种参数构成：第一是有生命参数、第二是有型参数，第三是功能参数。在我所调查的中国壮侗语言中，一些中心量词的语音结构有比较相同的发音。},

	abstract = {[Polynesian and Micronesian languages inherited a decimal number system from Proto-Oceanic, and individually extended it on one or more dimensions: in length by adding terms for larger numbers, in breadth by specifying numeral classifiers for certain objects (prevailing in Micronesia), and in factor by introducing a larger counting unit (prevailing in Polynesia). Specific counting systems are characterized by a combination of these features: They are based on larger counting units (multiplication function) and apply to certain objects only (object specificity). This paper surveys the distribution of each extension type in Polynesian and Micronesian number systems, characterizes the features that they share, and analyzes the constitutive role that numeral classifiers play for specific counting systems. It is concluded that in most of these languages, number systems are composed according to similar principles, while the divergence in classifiers, objects of reference, and factors chosen results from cultural adaptations, some of which might have been responses to socioeconomic requirements and served purposes of cognitive facilitation.]},

Although the high-land Aari cultivate some wheat and barley and keep many sheep, their staple foodstuff is {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextasciitilden8at, but from the lack of sophistication shown in their preparation of the latter, Haberland infers that for the Aari an {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextasciitilden8at - based culture is an adopted one (ibid., 421). Those Aari who inhabit the scarplands grow maize and sorghum varieties and keep small herds and flocks.},

As such, the analysis is based on very limited exposure to the language for the linguistically trained staff, and very little exposure to linguistics on behalf of the mother-tongue speakers, and thus must be considered only an initial and very tentative exploration of linguistic features.},

@phdthesis{gbery_studies_1987,
	type = {{PhD} {Thesis}},
	title = {Studies in the grammar of {Abbey}.},
	abstract = {This dissertation characterizes major aspects of the grammar of Abbey (a Kwa language the Ivory Coast), namely, Phonology, Morphology and Syntax. Following the introductory chapter that defines the aims and the theoretical model that governs the study, Chapter I presents a segmental phonology of Abbey. Within Stanley's (1967) framework, an examination of the morpheme structure conditions for lexical and grammatical morphemes, phonological rules, and an overview of Abbey tonology is undertaken. The chapter argues that it is futile to posit nasalized vowels as systematic phonemic segments in Abbey, and that contour tones are best represented as composite level tones rather than unitary tonal elements. Chapter II qualifies Halle's (1973) three-component Morphological model. Furthermore, the chapter discusses four word-formation rules, namely, compound-noun formation, "gerunds," agent-nouns, and reduplication. It is argued that a transformational account of "gerund" nominals cannot be sustained outside Serial Verb Constructions. A lexicalist approach which supplies each entry of the Morpheme List with paradigmatic and syntagmatic information makes a superior account of "gerunds" formation in Abbey. Agent-noun formation and morpheme root reduplication, respectively, qualifies the proposal that word-formation rules should have access to the Dictionary and that reduplication rules are integral parts of Abbey word formation rules rather than part of phonological rules. Chapter III in examines Serial Verb Constructions (SVCs) in Abbey. The constructions are a surface sentence containing two or more verbs without any connective element between them. Eddy dj\_ dzuma lo si Eddy did work gave father "Eddy worked for hh father" The most controversial aspects of the verbal constructions are the characterization of the nature of its major constituents and its syntactic source. Transformational analysis of the verbal construction is made possible by deletion under identity (Equi-NP deletion), coordinate reduction, and movement rules. In light of a critical review of the literature on SVCs in African languages, the study argues that a transformational derivation of verb serialization from underlying multiple sentences (coordinate and embedded sentences) is not motivated in African languages in general and Abbey in particular. A non-transformational approach based on a rewriting rule that allows a single simple sentence with a complex predicate (directly dominated by the [S] node) makes a better and simpler account of the phenomenon. Chapter IV summarizes each chapter of die study and presents son is concluding observations.},

In brief, chapter 1 gives a summary of the thesis, followed by a more detailed description of the Abu' language area and its dialects, as seen from a linguist's point of view, in chapter 2. This and Chapter ʒ, which gives an over sew of the grammar and phonology of Abu' , provide the general background knowledge of the nature of the language as a basis for the discussions on sociolinguistic aspects of Abu' in chapters 4 to 7. In chapter 4, the Abu' world-view is examined showing the relatively influential role it has on the determination of noun classes. This is followed in chapter 5, by a description of speaker's speech repertoire. This focusses on the pattern of verbal behaviour among different social groups. In chapter 6, non-verbal means of communication (excluding gestural communication) is treated. Chapter 7 examines language attitudes and use among the Abu .},

The study performs analysis on the structure and functions of Asheron phrases and clauses. It aims to set out rules and patters of the language from a syntactic point of view. It also tries to provide a foundation for further research in the language. The study falls into five chapters. Ch.1 is an introductory chapter which includes classification and historical background about the language. Ch.2 is a reviewof literature and linguistics background. Ch. 3 deals with the analysis of phrases. It also includes description of different word classes that found in Asheron language as well as the word order. Ch. 4 centers on the analysis of the structure of the clauses in the language. Ch. 5 summarizes the study and presents the conclusions and findings.},

	url = {https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/74212},
	doi = {10.26153/TSW/1343},
	abstract = {This dissertation provides a description of the Chácobo language, a southern Pano language spoken by approximately 1200 people who live close to or on the Geneshuaya, Ivon, Benicito and Yata rivers in the northern Bolivian Amazon. The grammatical description emerges out of an ethnographically based documentation project of the language. Chapter 1 contains an overview of the cultural context in which the Chácobo language is embedded and a brief ethnohistory of the Chácobo people. I also discuss the general methodology of the dissertation touching specifically on issues related to data collection. Chapter 2 introduces the phonology of the language focusing on the categories necessary for its description. Chapter 3 provides a discussion of morphosyntactic structures and relations. This chapter provides a discussion of how head-dependent relations and the general distinction between morphology and syntax are understood throughout the dissertation. Parts of speech classes (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs) are also defined and motivated based on semantic and formal criteria. Chapter 4 describes predication and its relationship to clause-typing. Chapter 5 is concerned with constituency which refers to hierarchical structures motivated through distributional properties and relations and the relative degree of contiguity between linguistic categories. Chapter 6 provides an extensive discussion of morphophonology and its relation to constituency. Chapter 7 and 8 are concerned with the language’s alignment and valence-adjusting systems. The next five chapters provide a description of the functional domains relevant to the verbal domain including; Tense (Chapter 9); Temporal distance (Chapter 10); Aspect (Chapter 11); Associated Motion (Chapter 12); Perspective (Chapter 13). The last two Chapters focus on categories in the nominal domain. Chapter 14 provides a description of noun compounding, adjectives and possession. Chapter 15 provides a description of number, quantification and deixis inside and outside the nominal domain.},

	abstract = {本文指出漢語個體量詞和非個體量詞雖然在語意屬性上有所差異，在詞類劃分上卻都是量詞，而不是經由名詞的移位而轉換過來的；相對的，英語中所謂的「度量詞」則仍屬名詞。這種非移位的語意屬性分析除了可以有系統的詮釋不同語言間的「持續詞」的可數性以及數詞與複數詞的共存限制，還可以避免Cheng \& Sybesma（1998, 1999）和Li（1999）等相關分析的語言事實和語言類型的問題。It is shown in this paper that in Chinese sortal and mensural classifiers differ from one another in their semantic-not categorial-feature, both being listed as Cl in the lexicon and none undergoing the syntactic operation of N-to-Cl movement. In English, by contrast, the so-called measure words are categorized as N, and not Cl. This feature and non-movement analysis of classifiers may explain in a principled way the cross-linguistic variation in the mass-count property of duration expressions, on the one hand, and the cross-linguistic co-occurrence restriction between numerals and plural morphology, on the other. Such an account is also free of some empirical and typological problems raised for Cheng \& Sybesma's (1998, 1999) theory of Chinese classifiers and Li's (1999) theory of Chinese plural morphology.},

Pendau belongs to the Tomini-Tolitoli subgroup, and this book is the first comprehensive description of any of these languages. The Tomini-Tolitoli languages are of interest to typologists in general and more specifically to Austronesianists, since the languages appear to be transitional between better known Philippine style languages and Indonesian style languages. Intricate rules of vowel harmony in the prefixes used to form verb stems are of particular interest. The grammar is very richly exemplified and covers a wide range of linguistic phenomena from phonetics and phonology through to cohesion and prominence in discourse as well as an analysis of the discourse structure of a number of different genres."–Provided by publisher},

	abstract = {Standard Tajik, or Modern Literary Tajik as it was called during the Soviet era, was established in the nineteen twenties and thirties based largely on the dialects of the Bukhara-Samarkand area, which was at the time the undisputed cultural centre of the Tajik-speaking population. Dushanbe, the current capital of Tajikistan, was then a small village with a population of only a few hundred and had no cultural heritage comparable to that of Bukhara or Samarkand. Bukharan Tajik, whose phonology is described in this paper, is a variety of Tajik that played a particularly influential role in the phonological standardization of Tajik, which took place for the most part in 1930. For instance, the Scientific Conference of Uzbekistan Tajiks of 1930 resolved that the dialect of Bukhara must be the designated basis of the sound and orthography of literary Tajik (вaroji tajjorī вa kanfiransijaji ilmiji istalinoвod 1930: 2). In August the same year, the Linguistic Conference held in the then newly established Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic also adopted a similar resolution that establishes the ‘language of the Tajiks of Samarkand and Bukhara’ as the reference point in establishing the literary (i.e. standard) pronunciation (Halimov 1974: 126). According to Bergne (2007: 82), ‘the same Linguistic Conference of 22 August 1930 in Stalinabad decided that the phonetic base for the language had better be the dialect of Bukhara’. Thus, the Bukharan Tajik of today is the direct descendant of the variety of Tajik which served as a primary basis of standard Tajik phonological norms; and hence differs little from standard Tajik phonologically and phonetically.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study is to analyse the system of Kam noun classifiers in synchronical typological and diachronical pan-Kam-Tai perspective. While Kam is at the center stage of this investigation, additional data are presented from a survey of 22 Kam-Tai languages which belong to four nationalities in the P.R. of China: the Dong, Bouyei, Shui and Zhuang nationalities. The main morphosyntax function of these Chinese Kam-Tai languages is to occur in quantificational constructions (numeral and quantifier) and in referential expressions (indefiniteness, demonstrative pronouns and nominalization). Classifiers in Chinese Kam-Tai languages appear in pre-nominal position and stand in constrast to classifiers of the Kam-Tai languages located in Burma, Thailand and Vietnam which typically project the classifier into post-nominal position. Concerning the semantics of classifier systems, the Chinese Kam-Tai languages involve animacy as primary parameter, dimensionality (shape) as secondary parameter, and functionality (or instrumentality) as tertiary parameter. The sound structure of a number of core-classifiers displays a surprisingly homogenous picture across the range of Kam-Tai languages surveyed.本文研究的目的是对侗语名量词在现时类型学方面和全壮侗语系历史性方面进行了分析。侗语是本文研究的重点，除此之外还增加了新的研究数据，这些新数据是来自22个壮侗语系语言的调查，这些壮侗语系的语言属于中国四个少数民族，即：侗族、布依族、水族和壮族。这些中国壮侗语言的主要语素句法的功能是表现在数量结构和引导结构（不定概念、指示代词和名物化）。中国壮侗语言的量词是位于每个名词前；不同于缅甸、泰国和越南的壮侗语言，后者的量词是位于每个名词后。量词体系的语义在中国壮侗语言中以三种参数构成：第一是有生命参数、第二是有型参数，第三是功能参数。在我所调查的中国壮侗语言中，一些中心量词的语音结构有比较相同的发音。},

	abstract = {[Polynesian and Micronesian languages inherited a decimal number system from Proto-Oceanic, and individually extended it on one or more dimensions: in length by adding terms for larger numbers, in breadth by specifying numeral classifiers for certain objects (prevailing in Micronesia), and in factor by introducing a larger counting unit (prevailing in Polynesia). Specific counting systems are characterized by a combination of these features: They are based on larger counting units (multiplication function) and apply to certain objects only (object specificity). This paper surveys the distribution of each extension type in Polynesian and Micronesian number systems, characterizes the features that they share, and analyzes the constitutive role that numeral classifiers play for specific counting systems. It is concluded that in most of these languages, number systems are composed according to similar principles, while the divergence in classifiers, objects of reference, and factors chosen results from cultural adaptations, some of which might have been responses to socioeconomic requirements and served purposes of cognitive facilitation.]},

According to Haberland (p.420 in Jensen 1959), the Aari comprise ten tribes, known as Bako, Kure, Shangama, Bio, Sido, Argenne, Ubamer, Bargedda, Galila and 1Gossa, with a total population of less than 20,000. Although the high-land Aari cultivate some wheat and barley and keep many sheep, their staple foodstuff is {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextasciitilden8at, but from the lack of sophistication shown in their preparation of the latter, Haberland infers that for the Aari an {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextbackslashtextasciitilden8at - based culture is an adopted one (ibid., 421).

As such, the analysis is based on very limited exposure to the language for the linguistically trained staff, and very little exposure to linguistics on behalf of the mother-tongue speakers, and thus must be considered only an initial and very tentative exploration of linguistic features.},

@phdthesis{gbery_studies_1987-1,
	type = {{PhD} {Thesis}},
	title = {Studies in the grammar of {Abbey}.},
	abstract = {This dissertation characterizes major aspects of the grammar of Abbey (a Kwa language the Ivory Coast), namely, Phonology, Morphology and Syntax. Following the introductory chapter that defines the aims and the theoretical model that governs the study, Chapter I presents a segmental phonology of Abbey. Within Stanley's (1967) framework, an examination of the morpheme structure conditions for lexical and grammatical morphemes, phonological rules, and an overview of Abbey tonology is undertaken. The chapter argues that it is futile to posit nasalized vowels as systematic phonemic segments in Abbey, and that contour tones are best represented as composite level tones rather than unitary tonal elements. Chapter II qualifies Halle's (1973) three-component Morphological model. Furthermore, the chapter discusses four word-formation rules, namely, compound-noun formation, "gerunds," agent-nouns, and reduplication. It is argued that a transformational account of "gerund" nominals cannot be sustained outside Serial Verb Constructions. A lexicalist approach which supplies each entry of the Morpheme List with paradigmatic and syntagmatic information makes a superior account of "gerunds" formation in Abbey. Agent-noun formation and morpheme root reduplication, respectively, qualifies the proposal that word-formation rules should have access to the Dictionary and that reduplication rules are integral parts of Abbey word formation rules rather than part of phonological rules. Chapter III in examines Serial Verb Constructions (SVCs) in Abbey. The constructions are a surface sentence containing two or more verbs without any connective element between them. Eddy dj\_ dzuma lo si Eddy did work gave father "Eddy worked for hh father" The most controversial aspects of the verbal constructions are the characterization of the nature of its major constituents and its syntactic source. Transformational analysis of the verbal construction is made possible by deletion under identity (Equi-NP deletion), coordinate reduction, and movement rules. In light of a critical review of the literature on SVCs in African languages, the study argues that a transformational derivation of verb serialization from underlying multiple sentences (coordinate and embedded sentences) is not motivated in African languages in general and Abbey in particular. A non-transformational approach based on a rewriting rule that allows a single simple sentence with a complex predicate (directly dominated by the [S] node) makes a better and simpler account of the phenomenon. Chapter IV summarizes each chapter of die study and presents son is concluding observations.},

It is the first of its kind on this community. In brief, chapter 1 gives a summary of the thesis, followed by a more detailed description of the Abu' language area and its dialects, as seen from a linguist's point of view, in chapter 2. This and Chapter ʒ, which gives an over sew of the grammar and phonology of Abu' , provide the general background knowledge of the nature of the language as a basis for the discussions on sociolinguistic aspects of Abu' in chapters 4 to 7. In chapter 4, the Abu' world-view is examined showing the relatively influential role it has on the determination of noun classes. This is followed in chapter 5, by a description of speaker's speech repertoire. This focusses on the pattern of verbal behaviour among different social groups. In chapter 6, non-verbal means of communication (excluding gestural communication) is treated. Chapter 7 examines language attitudes and use among the Abu .},

This authoritative reference source provides a unique description of the languages, covering their grammatical structure and historical development, plus sociolinguistic features. Each chapter combines modern linguistic perspective with traditional historical linguistics, and a uniform structure allows for easy typological comparison between the individual languages. New to this edition are chapters on Beṭṭa Kur̲umba, Kuṛux, Kūvi and Malayāḷam, enlarged sections in various existing chapters, as well updated bibliographies and demographic data throughout. The Dravidian Languages will be invaluable to students and researchers within linguistics, and will also be of interest to readers in the fields of comparative literature, areal linguistics and South Asian studies"–},

	abstract = {本文指出漢語個體量詞和非個體量詞雖然在語意屬性上有所差異，在詞類劃分上卻都是量詞，而不是經由名詞的移位而轉換過來的；相對的，英語中所謂的「度量詞」則仍屬名詞。這種非移位的語意屬性分析除了可以有系統的詮釋不同語言間的「持續詞」的可數性以及數詞與複數詞的共存限制，還可以避免Cheng \& Sybesma（1998, 1999）和Li（1999）等相關分析的語言事實和語言類型的問題。It is shown in this paper that in Chinese sortal and mensural classifiers differ from one another in their semantic-not categorial-feature, both being listed as Cl in the lexicon and none undergoing the syntactic operation of N-to-Cl movement. In English, by contrast, the so-called measure words are categorized as N, and not Cl. This feature and non-movement analysis of classifiers may explain in a principled way the cross-linguistic variation in the mass-count property of duration expressions, on the one hand, and the cross-linguistic co-occurrence restriction between numerals and plural morphology, on the other. Such an account is also free of some empirical and typological problems raised for Cheng \& Sybesma's (1998, 1999) theory of Chinese classifiers and Li's (1999) theory of Chinese plural morphology.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study is to analyse the system of Kam noun classifiers in synchronical typological and diachronical pan-Kam-Tai perspective. While Kam is at the center stage of this investigation, additional data are presented from a survey of 22 Kam-Tai languages which belong to four nationalities in the P.R. of China: the Dong, Bouyei, Shui and Zhuang nationalities. The main morphosyntax function of these Chinese Kam-Tai languages is to occur in quantificational constructions (numeral and quantifier) and in referential expressions (indefiniteness, demonstrative pronouns and nominalization). Classifiers in Chinese Kam-Tai languages appear in pre-nominal position and stand in constrast to classifiers of the Kam-Tai languages located in Burma, Thailand and Vietnam which typically project the classifier into post-nominal position. Concerning the semantics of classifier systems, the Chinese Kam-Tai languages involve animacy as primary parameter, dimensionality (shape) as secondary parameter, and functionality (or instrumentality) as tertiary parameter. The sound structure of a number of core-classifiers displays a surprisingly homogenous picture across the range of Kam-Tai languages surveyed.本文研究的目的是对侗语名量词在现时类型学方面和全壮侗语系历史性方面进行了分析。侗语是本文研究的重点，除此之外还增加了新的研究数据，这些新数据是来自22个壮侗语系语言的调查，这些壮侗语系的语言属于中国四个少数民族，即：侗族、布依族、水族和壮族。这些中国壮侗语言的主要语素句法的功能是表现在数量结构和引导结构（不定概念、指示代词和名物化）。中国壮侗语言的量词是位于每个名词前；不同于缅甸、泰国和越南的壮侗语言，后者的量词是位于每个名词后。量词体系的语义在中国壮侗语言中以三种参数构成：第一是有生命参数、第二是有型参数，第三是功能参数。在我所调查的中国壮侗语言中，一些中心量词的语音结构有比较相同的发音。},

	abstract = {[Polynesian and Micronesian languages inherited a decimal number system from Proto-Oceanic, and individually extended it on one or more dimensions: in length by adding terms for larger numbers, in breadth by specifying numeral classifiers for certain objects (prevailing in Micronesia), and in factor by introducing a larger counting unit (prevailing in Polynesia). Specific counting systems are characterized by a combination of these features: They are based on larger counting units (multiplication function) and apply to certain objects only (object specificity). This paper surveys the distribution of each extension type in Polynesian and Micronesian number systems, characterizes the features that they share, and analyzes the constitutive role that numeral classifiers play for specific counting systems. It is concluded that in most of these languages, number systems are composed according to similar principles, while the divergence in classifiers, objects of reference, and factors chosen results from cultural adaptations, some of which might have been responses to socioeconomic requirements and served purposes of cognitive facilitation.]},

According to Haberland (p.420 in Jensen 1959), the Aari comprise ten tribes, known as Bako, Kure, Shangama, Bio, Sido, Argenne, Ubamer, Bargedda, Galila and 1Gossa, with a total population of less than 20,000. Although the high-land Aari cultivate some wheat and barley and keep many sheep, their staple foodstuff is {\textbackslash}textasciitilden8at, but from the lack of sophistication shown in their preparation of the latter, Haberland infers that for the Aari an {\textbackslash}textasciitilden8at - based culture is an adopted one (ibid., 421). Those Aari who inhabit the scarplands grow maize and sorghum varieties and keep small herds and flocks.},

As such, the analysis is based on very limited exposure to the language for the linguistically trained staff, and very little exposure to linguistics on behalf of the mother-tongue speakers, and thus must be considered only an initial and very tentative exploration of linguistic features.},

	type = {{PhD} {Thesis}},
	title = {Studies in the grammar of {Abbey}.},
	abstract = {This dissertation characterizes major aspects of the grammar of Abbey (a Kwa language the Ivory Coast), namely, Phonology, Morphology and Syntax. Following the introductory chapter that defines the aims and the theoretical model that governs the study, Chapter I presents a segmental phonology of Abbey. Within Stanley's (1967) framework, an examination of the morpheme structure conditions for lexical and grammatical morphemes, phonological rules, and an overview of Abbey tonology is undertaken. The chapter argues that it is futile to posit nasalized vowels as systematic phonemic segments in Abbey, and that contour tones are best represented as composite level tones rather than unitary tonal elements. Chapter II qualifies Halle's (1973) three-component Morphological model. Furthermore, the chapter discusses four word-formation rules, namely, compound-noun formation, "gerunds," agent-nouns, and reduplication. It is argued that a transformational account of "gerund" nominals cannot be sustained outside Serial Verb Constructions. A lexicalist approach which supplies each entry of the Morpheme List with paradigmatic and syntagmatic information makes a superior account of "gerunds" formation in Abbey. Agent-noun formation and morpheme root reduplication, respectively, qualifies the proposal that word-formation rules should have access to the Dictionary and that reduplication rules are integral parts of Abbey word formation rules rather than part of phonological rules. Chapter III in examines Serial Verb Constructions (SVCs) in Abbey. The constructions are a surface sentence containing two or more verbs without any connective element between them. Eddy dj\_ dzuma lo si Eddy did work gave father "Eddy worked for hh father" The most controversial aspects of the verbal constructions are the characterization of the nature of its major constituents and its syntactic source. Transformational analysis of the verbal construction is made possible by deletion under identity (Equi-NP deletion), coordinate reduction, and movement rules. In light of a critical review of the literature on SVCs in African languages, the study argues that a transformational derivation of verb serialization from underlying multiple sentences (coordinate and embedded sentences) is not motivated in African languages in general and Abbey in particular. A non-transformational approach based on a rewriting rule that allows a single simple sentence with a complex predicate (directly dominated by the [S] node) makes a better and simpler account of the phenomenon. Chapter IV summarizes each chapter of die study and presents son is concluding observations.},

In brief, chapter 1 gives a summary of the thesis, followed by a more detailed description of the Abu' language area and its dialects, as seen from a linguist's point of view, in chapter 2. This and Chapter ʒ, which gives an over sew of the grammar and phonology of Abu' , provide the general background knowledge of the nature of the language as a basis for the discussions on sociolinguistic aspects of Abu' in chapters 4 to 7. In chapter 4, the Abu' world-view is examined showing the relatively influential role it has on the determination of noun classes. This is followed in chapter 5, by a description of speaker's speech repertoire. This focusses on the pattern of verbal behaviour among different social groups. In chapter 6, non-verbal means of communication (excluding gestural communication) is treated. Chapter 7 examines language attitudes and use among the Abu .},

	url = {https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/74212},
	doi = {10.26153/TSW/1343},
	abstract = {This dissertation provides a description of the Chácobo language, a southern Pano language spoken by approximately 1200 people who live close to or on the Geneshuaya, Ivon, Benicito and Yata rivers in the northern Bolivian Amazon. The grammatical description emerges out of an ethnographically based documentation project of the language. Chapter 1 contains an overview of the cultural context in which the Chácobo language is embedded and a brief ethnohistory of the Chácobo people. I also discuss the general methodology of the dissertation touching specifically on issues related to data collection. Chapter 2 introduces the phonology of the language focusing on the categories necessary for its description. Chapter 3 provides a discussion of morphosyntactic structures and relations. This chapter provides a discussion of how head-dependent relations and the general distinction between morphology and syntax are understood throughout the dissertation. Parts of speech classes (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs) are also defined and motivated based on semantic and formal criteria. Chapter 4 describes predication and its relationship to clause-typing. Chapter 5 is concerned with constituency which refers to hierarchical structures motivated through distributional properties and relations and the relative degree of contiguity between linguistic categories. Chapter 6 provides an extensive discussion of morphophonology and its relation to constituency. Chapter 7 and 8 are concerned with the language’s alignment and valence-adjusting systems. The next five chapters provide a description of the functional domains relevant to the verbal domain including; Tense (Chapter 9); Temporal distance (Chapter 10); Aspect (Chapter 11); Associated Motion (Chapter 12); Perspective (Chapter 13). The last two Chapters focus on categories in the nominal domain. Chapter 14 provides a description of noun compounding, adjectives and possession. Chapter 15 provides a description of number, quantification and deixis inside and outside the nominal domain.},

	abstract = {本文指出漢語個體量詞和非個體量詞雖然在語意屬性上有所差異，在詞類劃分上卻都是量詞，而不是經由名詞的移位而轉換過來的；相對的，英語中所謂的「度量詞」則仍屬名詞。這種非移位的語意屬性分析除了可以有系統的詮釋不同語言間的「持續詞」的可數性以及數詞與複數詞的共存限制，還可以避免Cheng \& Sybesma（1998, 1999）和Li（1999）等相關分析的語言事實和語言類型的問題。It is shown in this paper that in Chinese sortal and mensural classifiers differ from one another in their semantic-not categorial-feature, both being listed as Cl in the lexicon and none undergoing the syntactic operation of N-to-Cl movement. In English, by contrast, the so-called measure words are categorized as N, and not Cl. This feature and non-movement analysis of classifiers may explain in a principled way the cross-linguistic variation in the mass-count property of duration expressions, on the one hand, and the cross-linguistic co-occurrence restriction between numerals and plural morphology, on the other. Such an account is also free of some empirical and typological problems raised for Cheng \& Sybesma's (1998, 1999) theory of Chinese classifiers and Li's (1999) theory of Chinese plural morphology.},

The Tomini-Tolitoli languages are of interest to typologists in general and more specifically to Austronesianists, since the languages appear to be transitional between better known Philippine style languages and Indonesian style languages. Intricate rules of vowel harmony in the prefixes used to form verb stems are of particular interest. The grammar is very richly exemplified and covers a wide range of linguistic phenomena from phonetics and phonology through to cohesion and prominence in discourse as well as an analysis of the discourse structure of a number of different genres."--Provided by publisher},

	abstract = {Standard Tajik, or Modern Literary Tajik as it was called during the Soviet era, was established in the nineteen twenties and thirties based largely on the dialects of the Bukhara-Samarkand area, which was at the time the undisputed cultural centre of the Tajik-speaking population. Dushanbe, the current capital of Tajikistan, was then a small village with a population of only a few hundred and had no cultural heritage comparable to that of Bukhara or Samarkand. Bukharan Tajik, whose phonology is described in this paper, is a variety of Tajik that played a particularly influential role in the phonological standardization of Tajik, which took place for the most part in 1930. For instance, the Scientific Conference of Uzbekistan Tajiks of 1930 resolved that the dialect of Bukhara must be the designated basis of the sound and orthography of literary Tajik (вaroji tajjorī вa kanfiransijaji ilmiji istalinoвod 1930: 2). In August the same year, the Linguistic Conference held in the then newly established Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic also adopted a similar resolution that establishes the ‘language of the Tajiks of Samarkand and Bukhara’ as the reference point in establishing the literary (i.e. standard) pronunciation (Halimov 1974: 126). According to Bergne (2007: 82), ‘the same Linguistic Conference of 22 August 1930 in Stalinabad decided that the phonetic base for the language had better be the dialect of Bukhara’. Thus, the Bukharan Tajik of today is the direct descendant of the variety of Tajik which served as a primary basis of standard Tajik phonological norms; and hence differs little from standard Tajik phonologically and phonetically.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study is to analyse the system of Kam noun classifiers in synchronical typological and diachronical pan-Kam-Tai perspective. While Kam is at the center stage of this investigation, additional data are presented from a survey of 22 Kam-Tai languages which belong to four nationalities in the P.R. of China: the Dong, Bouyei, Shui and Zhuang nationalities. The main morphosyntax function of these Chinese Kam-Tai languages is to occur in quantificational constructions (numeral and quantifier) and in referential expressions (indefiniteness, demonstrative pronouns and nominalization). Classifiers in Chinese Kam-Tai languages appear in pre-nominal position and stand in constrast to classifiers of the Kam-Tai languages located in Burma, Thailand and Vietnam which typically project the classifier into post-nominal position. Concerning the semantics of classifier systems, the Chinese Kam-Tai languages involve animacy as primary parameter, dimensionality (shape) as secondary parameter, and functionality (or instrumentality) as tertiary parameter. The sound structure of a number of core-classifiers displays a surprisingly homogenous picture across the range of Kam-Tai languages surveyed.本文研究的目的是对侗语名量词在现时类型学方面和全壮侗语系历史性方面进行了分析。侗语是本文研究的重点，除此之外还增加了新的研究数据，这些新数据是来自22个壮侗语系语言的调查，这些壮侗语系的语言属于中国四个少数民族，即：侗族、布依族、水族和壮族。这些中国壮侗语言的主要语素句法的功能是表现在数量结构和引导结构（不定概念、指示代词和名物化）。中国壮侗语言的量词是位于每个名词前；不同于缅甸、泰国和越南的壮侗语言，后者的量词是位于每个名词后。量词体系的语义在中国壮侗语言中以三种参数构成：第一是有生命参数、第二是有型参数，第三是功能参数。在我所调查的中国壮侗语言中，一些中心量词的语音结构有比较相同的发音。},

	abstract = {[Polynesian and Micronesian languages inherited a decimal number system from Proto-Oceanic, and individually extended it on one or more dimensions: in length by adding terms for larger numbers, in breadth by specifying numeral classifiers for certain objects (prevailing in Micronesia), and in factor by introducing a larger counting unit (prevailing in Polynesia). Specific counting systems are characterized by a combination of these features: They are based on larger counting units (multiplication function) and apply to certain objects only (object specificity). This paper surveys the distribution of each extension type in Polynesian and Micronesian number systems, characterizes the features that they share, and analyzes the constitutive role that numeral classifiers play for specific counting systems. It is concluded that in most of these languages, number systems are composed according to similar principles, while the divergence in classifiers, objects of reference, and factors chosen results from cultural adaptations, some of which might have been responses to socioeconomic requirements and served purposes of cognitive facilitation.]},

	doi = {10.26153/TSW/1343},
	abstract = {This dissertation provides a description of the Chácobo language, a southern Pano language spoken by approximately 1200 people who live close to or on the Geneshuaya, Ivon, Benicito and Yata rivers in the northern Bolivian Amazon. The grammatical description emerges out of an ethnographically based documentation project of the language. Chapter 1 contains an overview of the cultural context in which the Chácobo language is embedded and a brief ethnohistory of the Chácobo people. I also discuss the general methodology of the dissertation touching specifically on issues related to data collection. Chapter 2 introduces the phonology of the language focusing on the categories necessary for its description. Chapter 3 provides a discussion of morphosyntactic structures and relations. This chapter provides a discussion of how head-dependent relations and the general distinction between morphology and syntax are understood throughout the dissertation. Parts of speech classes (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs) are also defined and motivated based on semantic and formal criteria. Chapter 4 describes predication and its relationship to clause-typing. Chapter 5 is concerned with constituency which refers to hierarchical structures motivated through distributional properties and relations and the relative degree of contiguity between linguistic categories. Chapter 6 provides an extensive discussion of morphophonology and its relation to constituency. Chapter 7 and 8 are concerned with the language’s alignment and valence-adjusting systems. The next five chapters provide a description of the functional domains relevant to the verbal domain including; Tense (Chapter 9); Temporal distance (Chapter 10); Aspect (Chapter 11); Associated Motion (Chapter 12); Perspective (Chapter 13). The last two Chapters focus on categories in the nominal domain. Chapter 14 provides a description of noun compounding, adjectives and possession. Chapter 15 provides a description of number, quantification and deixis inside and outside the nominal domain.},

	title = {A grammar of {Cuwabo} ({Mozambique}, {Bantu} {P34})},
	abstract = {Cuwabo is a Bantu language, spoken by more than 800,000 people (INE 2007) in the north-eastern part of Mozambique. It is numbered P34 in Guthrie’s classification, and thus belongs to the P30 Makhuwa group. Cuwabo can be subdivided into five main varieties: central Cuwabo, Karungu, Mayindo, Nyaringa, and Manyawa. This work is based on central Cuwabo spoken in the district of Quelimane. First-hand data were recorded from 10 speakers in the course of three fieldtrips realised between 2011 and 2013, achieving a total duration of 10 months. This thesis provides a grammatical description of the language, covering in detail its phonology and its morphosyntax. Phonology is divided into two chapters: the first is devoted to segmental phonology whereas the second describes the tonal system of the language. Note that Cuwabo is the only P30 language whose nominal and verbal stems have retained a lexical tone contrast. Morphologically, the noun phrase is marked by a rich agreement system ruled by the noun classes, as typical in Bantu. Cuwabo has a highly agglutinative verbal morphology, which conveys a rich Tense-Aspect-Mood system combining both prefixes and final suffixes. Note the existence of several enclitics depending on the constructions (locative enclitics, personal pronoun enclitics in relative clauses, comitative or instrumental enclitics). The last three chapters address syntactic issues: the first presents a description of the basic clause structure, involving verbal and non-verbal predication; the second looks into the relative constructions in close interaction with question formation; the last one investigates word order and information structure in Cuwabo. Preverbal and postverbal constituents are examined, as well as their interaction with the morphological marking on the verb, distinguishing conjoint and disjoint tenses. The appendix contains seven Cuwabo texts glossed and translated into English, which allow to illustrate in context many of the grammatical items presented in the descriptive chapters.},

The analysis is informed by a functional-typological framework and draws on a corpus of data gathered through elicitation, observation and recordings of natural discourse. Every effort has been made to describe day-to-day language, so whenever possible, illustrative examples are taken from extemporaneous speech and contextualized. Sections of the grammar should appeal widely to scholars interested in South Asia's languages and cultures, including discussions of the socio-cultural setting, the sound system, morphosyntactic, clause and discourse structure. The grammar's interlinearized texts and glossary provide a trove of useful information for comparative linguists working on Tibeto-Burman languages and anyone interested in the world's less-commonly spoken languages"–},

	abstract = {This volume, the result of seven years of fieldwork, is the only comprehensive grammar of the underdocumented Digo (Chidigo) language to date. Digo is the southernmost language of the Mijikenda cluster of Bantu languages, spoken along the coast of East Africa in Kenya and Tanzania. Besides a clear description of Digo morphology and syntax, with multiple illustrative examples, this grammar includes several glossed texts, a 1700-item wordlist, and a list of over 100 botanical names. It gives particular emphasis to semantic and discourse relations of elements which are not always analyzed from this perspective in grammatical descriptions. These include the forms and functions of Digo's complex system of demonstratives, a description of over 30 tense, aspect, and movement markers, and a detailed discussion of information structure and non-verbal clauses. This book will be of interest to linguists concerned with Bantu languages, typology, morphosyntax, and semantics. The entire Mijikenda cluster is underdocumented, and this grammar makes a significant contribution to understanding of languages of that area},

	abstract = {This dissertation is concerned with synchronic variation as the reflection and residue of language change. It springs from the need to account for the numerous ways of expressing negation in contemporary Grassfield Bantu, given the observation that many languages across the continents make use of a single marker for the same purpose. The leading research question is whether there exists a roadmap susceptible to lead from one of the extremes to the other. The answer to this question establishes a connection between synchronic variation and diachrony.0Using cross-generational variation within Grassfield Bantu, macro-variation data from languages with historical records, and micro-variation data from closely related Bamileke languages, it is argued that grammar internal variation of the kind observed in Grassfield Bantuis the manifestation of language change. This approach constitutes an inspiration for the analysis of languages that don\&\#x92;t have written records from previous generations.},

	abstract = {Pichi is an Afro-Caribbean English-lexifier Creole spoken on the island of Bioko, Equatorial Guinea. It is an offshoot of 19th century Krio (Sierra Leone) and shares many characteristics with West African relatives like Nigerian Pidgin, Cameroon Pidgin, and Ghanaian Pidgin English, as well as with the English-lexifier creoles of the insular and continental Caribbean. This comprehensive description presents a detailed analysis of the grammar and phonology of Pichi. It also includes a collection of texts and wordlists. Pichi features a nominative-accusative alignment, SVO word order, adjective-noun order, prenominal determiners, and prepositions. The language has a seven-vowel system and twenty-two consonant phonemes. Pichi has a two-tone system with tonal minimal pairs, morphological tone, and tonal processes. The morphological structure is largely isolating.},

	abstract = {"The similarity between Filipino and Tagalog is so striking that many Filipinos and non-Filipinos have ceased to distinguish them as separate languages. When asked what language they are speaking, many Filipinos will loosely reply, 'Filipino', when in fact they are speaking Tagalog. An internet search for a 'Filipino' language course will invariably bring results for a Tagalog language course. Some writers have referred to Filipino as a de facto version of Tagalog. Others have simply referred to Filipino as Tagalog plus . Tagalog, even when referred to as Filipino, is the living language of this programme. For Filipinos living abroad, Tagalog has become the language of choice. Filipinos moving around in their own homeland use Tagalog as the preferred means of communication. Whether you are confused, bemused or excited by the variety of Filipino languages or were simply drawn to learn Filipino (Tagalog) in the hope of building new language skills, you have come to the right place! With a solid foundation in Tagalog, access to the riches of Filipino culture, life and relationships will be opened up to you as never before."--Publisher's description.},

	abstract = {The book establishes 28 phonemic consonants and 7 vowels, as well as lexical and grammatical tones in Igala. It shows the canonical syllable types as V and CV with no complexity, and relates resyllabification to the retiming of segments as tone bearing units and the duration of their mora. The work discusses nine word classes, as well as ideophones and clitics in Igala. There are splitting verbs of various structures and fully-fledged pronouns with morphologically toneless clitic counterparts that are toned in their syntactic context, among other elements of the Igala morphology. The work establishes clitics as generally bearing the grammatical tones of various categories as a result of their morphological tonelessness and their availability for post-lexical tone assignment. It also accounts for the generally complex interaction of clitics and tones in the organisation of the morphosyntax and the tone-syntax interface. Igala has both verbal and nominal extensional affixes with various semantic features. Some interesting discussions in the Igala syntax include the structural and functional types of serial verb constructions, the detransitivizing process of verb movement in object demoting structures, coreferentiality in relativised constituents and the future/non-future temporal distinction. Complementary binominals are conjoined with a specified binominal morpheme, and their rigidly irreversible structures have implications in the Igala semantics. The binominals demonstrate a grammatically specified pattern defined over a conceptual space, showing the network among conceptual categories, such as kinship, marital, social, hunter-hunted, more-less and cause-effect relationships as reflected in the Igala grammar.},

Three main observations motivate the study: Strong documentation and a relatively large and active speaker community create a unique opportunity to document information structure in Isthmus Zapotec and to study the language as it is used by speakers in everyday life; As a tonal and verb-initial language, the examination of Isthmus Zapotec represents a chance to explore the possible combinations of tone, intonation, morphology and verb-initial syntax that may occur in the coding of information structure.},

The Mouton Pacific Linguistics series represents a continuation of this publishing venture under the same Editorial Board. The Pacific Linguistics series presents linguistic descriptions, dictionaries, and other materials concerned with languages of this region. The authors and editors of Pacific Linguistics publications are drawn from a wide range of institutions around the world, and its publications are refereed by international scholars with relevant expertise. Pacific Linguistics has built a reputation as the most authoritative publisher of works on the languages of the Pacific and neighbouring areas, read by scholars with an interest in the region as well as by linguists with interests in language typology, sociolinguistics, language contact and the reconstruction of linguistic change and culture history. Pacific Linguistics is proud to act as a vehicle for the dissemination of knowledge about the languages of the Pacific and the Pacific Rim, many of which are little known, and to bring them to the attention of scholars around the world, as well as providing local communities with published language material, at a time when many minority languages are under threat},

The paper highlights several points of typological, dialectological, and theoretical interest in this language. For example, the nominal morphology exhibits a somewhat unusual pattern of plural marking that interacts in a complex way with the gender marking system. Where relevant, comparisons are made between this dialect and other dialects of Maay and Somali, and speculation is made as to the historical origin of some of the unusual phonological and morphological phenomena observed in this dialect.},

	abstract = {There are no longer any speakers of the West Australian Aboriginal language Malgana who have any degree of fluency, and the series of analyses in this report are based on data from audio tapes made in the middle of the last decade of the 20th century, as well as various written materials produced over more than 150 years. This grammar is therefore an attempt to salvage from the scarce material available as complete a description of Malgana as possible. Nevertheless, the character of Malgana shines through what remains. For example, typical of Pama-Nyungan languages in general, Malgana exhibits split-ergative nominal marking, and of Aboriginal languages of the central West of Australia in particular, Malgana displays a full contrastive laminal series of stops in its phonology. A conscious effort has been made to provide in this grammar as many resources as possible for the researcher interested in comparative study of the surrounding languages. To this end, a (Malgana-based) comparative wordlist has been constructed for the languages of the region centring on the Murchison River: Malgana, Nhanda, Badimaya, Wajarri, and (Southern and Northern) Yingkarta},

The family is comprised of five languages: Kaket, Mali, Simbali, Ura and Kairak. Baining people share a common non-Austronesian ancestral language and similar cultural practices (such as fire dances). An interesting feature of these languages is that they show a great deal of influence from their early Austronesian neighbors. As detailed in the grammar, Mali has characteristics of both the Western Oceanic branch of Austronesian and Trans New Guinea. This is the first comprehensive grammar for a language from the family and provides a framework for further comparative and descriptive research in the region. The grammar was produced in cooperation with members of the Mali (Baining) community and is being published alongside a dictionary and text collection (also available from Pacific Linguistics)},

	abstract = {This grammar provides a synchronic grammatical description of Mauwake, a Papuan Trans-New Guinea (TNG) language of about 2000 speakers on the north coast of the Madang Province in Papua New Guinea. It is the first book-length treatment of the Mauwake language and the only published grammar of the Kumil subgroup to date. Relying on other existing published and unpublished grammars, the author shows how the language is similar to, or different from, related TNG languages especially in the Madang province. The grammar gives a brief introduction to the Mauwake people, their environment and their culture. Although the book mainly covers morphology and syntax, it also includes ashort treatment of the phonological system and the orthography. The description of the grammatical units proceeds from the words/morphology to the phrases, clauses, sentence types and clause combinations. The chapter on functional domains is the only one where the organization is based on meaning/function rather than structure. The longest chapter in the book is on morphology, with verbs taking the central stage. The final chapter deals with the pragmatic functions theme, topic and focus. 13 texts by native speakers, mostly recorded and transcribed but some originally written, are included in the Appendix with morpheme-by-morpheme glosses and a free translation. The theoretical approach used is that of Basic Linguistic Theory. Language typologists and professional Papuanist linguists are naturally one target audience for the grammar. But also two other possible, and important, audiences influenced especially the style the writing: well educated Mauwake speakers interested in their language, and those other Papua New Guineans who have some basic training in linguistics and are keen to explore their own languages.},

According to Haberland (p.420 in Jensen 1959), the Aari comprise ten tribes, known as Bako, Kure, Shangama, Bio, Sido, Argenne, Ubamer, Bargedda, Galila and 1Gossa, with a total population of less than 20,000. Although the high-land Aari cultivate some wheat and barley and keep many sheep, their staple foodstuff is {\textasciitilde}n8at, but from the lack of sophistication shown in their preparation of the latter, Haberland infers that for the Aari an {\textasciitilde}n8at - based culture is an adopted one (ibid., 421). Those Aari who inhabit the scarplands grow maize and sorghum varieties and keep small herds and flocks.},

@phdthesis{gbery_studies_1987,
	type = {doctoral dissertation},
	title = {Studies in the grammar of {Abbey}.},
	abstract = {This dissertation characterizes major aspects of the grammar of Abbey (a Kwa language the Ivory Coast), namely, Phonology, Morphology and Syntax. 
Following the introductory chapter that defines the aims and the theoretical model that governs the study, Chapter I presents a segmental phonology of Abbey. Within Stanley's (1967) framework, an examination of the morpheme structure conditions for lexical and grammatical morphemes, phonological rules, and an overview of Abbey tonology is
undertaken. The chapter argues that it is futile to posit nasalized vowels as systematic phonemic segments in Abbey, and that contour tones are best
represented as composite level tones rather than unitary tonal elements.
Chapter II qualifies Halle's (1973) three-component Morphological
model. Furthermore, the chapter discusses four word-formation rules,
namely, compound-noun formation, "gerunds," agent-nouns, and
reduplication. It is argued that a transformational account of "gerund" nominals cannot be sustained outside Serial Verb Constructions. A lexicalist approach which supplies each entry of the Morpheme List with paradigmatic and syntagmatic information makes a superior account of "gerunds" formation in Abbey. 
Agent-noun formation and morpheme root reduplication, respectively, qualifies the proposal that word-formation rules should have access to the Dictionary and that reduplication rules are integral parts of Abbey word formation rules rather than part of phonological rules.
Chapter III in examines Serial Verb Constructions (SVCs) in Abbey. The constructions are a surface sentence containing two or more verbs without any connective element between them.

Eddy dj\_ dzuma lo si
Eddy did work gave father
"Eddy worked for hh father"

The most controversial aspects of the verbal constructions are the
characterization of the nature of its major constituents and its syntactic
source. Transformational analysis of the verbal construction is made
possible by deletion under identity (Equi-NP deletion), coordinate reduction, and movement rules. In light of a critical review of the literature on SVCs in African languages, the study argues that a transformational derivation of verb serialization from underlying multiple sentences (coordinate and embedded sentences) is not motivated in African languages in general and Abbey in particular. A non-transformational approach based on a rewriting rule that allows a single simple sentence with a complex predicate (directly dominated by the [S] node) makes a better and simpler account of the phenomenon. 
Chapter IV summarizes each chapter of die study and presents son is concluding observations.},

ʒ, which gives an over sew of the grammar and phonology of Abu' ,
provide the general background knowledge of the nature of the language as a basis for the discussions on sociolinguistic aspects of Abu' in chapters 4 to 7. In chapter 4, the Abu' world-view is examined showing the relatively influential role it has on the determination of noun classes. This is followed in chapter 5, by a description of speaker's speech repertoire. This focusses on the pattern of verbal behaviour among different social groups. In chapter 6, non-verbal means of communication (excluding gestural communication) is treated. Chapter 7 examines language attitudes and use among the Abu .},

	abstract = {This thesis is a cross-dialectal grammar-sketch of the Western dialect group of Lamaholot, an Austronesian language spoken in Eastern Indonesia. It is a synthesis of the author’s own fieldwork data with the existing literature on the various dialects that belong to this group. Western Lamaholot has a little over 20 distinct phonemes, a strong tendency towards CV syllables, and penultimate stress. It has SV and AVP word order but frequently shows fronting of non-focused elements. It makes use of serial verbs and a lot of the function words that are used are grammaticallized serial verbs.
Nouns show a distinction between alienable and inalienable possession in possessive constructions. Some verbs are inflected for person and number through prefixes, and intransitive verbs sometimes get subject agreement suffixes. Adjectives, pronouns, and in some dialects demonstratives and numerals get a suffix -n, historically derived from genitive markers, when they are used as noun modifiers. This thesis discusses controversial topics in the Lamaholot literature such as the phonemic status of long vowels,
the existence of adjectives as a separate class from verbs, and the exact function of -n. It also lists elements that vary between dialects such as object marking on verbs, word-final consonants, and possessive constructions.},

The language is now extinct and the only material available to the author was that recorded by Hale from the last known speaker in 1960. The thesis therefore begins with a consideration of the limitations of the corpus and some of the strategies used to circumvent them. Foremost among these has been comparison with the neighbouring, closely related Kuku Thaypan language, currently being studied by Rigsby. A consideration of the pattern of land-language and social relationships on Cape York Peninsula illustrates the way in which social groups may be connected while still maintaining their distinctiveness. This is the basis for a rationale that allows the Thaypan data to be used inconsideration of Tharrnggala.

The linguistic analysis is divided in the usual way into chapters on phonology, morphology, syntax and semantics. Aghu Tharrnggala is an initial-dropping language, which renders it phonologically more complex than many other Australian languages. In morphology and syntax it is more typical of the common agglutinative, suffixing Pama-Nyungan family. Nouns are marked for case on an ergative-absolutive pattern, while pronouns are marked on a nominative-accusative one. The restricted scope of the corpus makes it hard to say much about semantic structure and the thesis concludes with a consideration of the ways in which knowledge of Aghu Tharrnggala might, at this late date, be increased.},

Aguaruna is spoken in the Eastern foothills of the Andes, and has typological similarities to both Amazonian and Andean languages.

The thesis consists of 13 chapters. The first is a general introduction to the Aguaruna language and people, the second covers phonology and the third word classes. Chapter 4 describes the morphology of nouns and adjectives, and Chapter 5 describes the composition of the noun phrase. Chapters 6 to 10 describe all aspects of verbal morphology, including relativised and nominalised verbs. Chapter 11 covers the structure of the clause, and Chapter 12 describes clause combining. Chapter 13 addresses some issues in discourse organisation. Two complete texts and extracts from a third are appended, fully glossed and translated.

This is the first grammar to address issues in Aguaruna morphology and syntax in detail, and also proposes a revised analysis of Proto-Jivaroan phonology.},

Agutaynen has three basic types of nominal markers for personal noun phrases: Nominative, Genitive and Oblique. Markers for common noun phrases show variation in each type, however. A definite/indefinite distinction in the “Genitive” leads to the analysis of Agutaynen tang as a Definite marker. Further variation in the “Nominative” and “Oblique” forms are also considered. Agutaynen makes a three-way, tense/aspect distinction--Perfective, Imperfective and Contemplated—easily demonstrated through the mag- set of Actor-voice (intransitive) prefixes. Two aspectual particles (da and pa) and one modal particle (din) are also considered.},

This conclusion is based on a comparison of several syntactic categories in Àhàn to those of standard Yoruba. An investigation of the nominal system and functional categories such as markers of tense, aspect, focus, negation and relativization are language internal evidences that support the claims of this thesis. The dissertation has both descriptive and theoretical ambitions. The descriptive part of the dissertation provides basic outline of the grammar of the language and also provides an outline of the various syntactic phenomenon that are language specific to Àhàn. The theoretical side of the dissertation examines aspect of the syntax of the language under the latest theory of generative syntax called the Minimalist Program. The applicability of Àhàn data to the claims of Minimalist syntax (Chomsky 1995, 2001 and Kayne 1994) and the modifications of the theory where necessary are part of the theoretical endeavor of this dissertation. Using the principles of microcomparative syntax (Richard Kayne 1989, 2000 2012), the thesis demonstrate how structural comparison of aspects of the syntax of Àhàn and Yoruba explicate linguistic variation, and how differences that exist between closely related languages provide data for our understanding of the properties of Universal Grammar (Collins 2013).},

In this language, the tone born by a pronoun is conditioned by the environment where it occurs. In other words, a first person pronoun subject can be a high, mid or a low tone. We also observe that in this language, pronoun can change its morphological form when it occurs in a particular syntactic environment as against the other. We shall also show, in the paper that pronouns in Àhàn inflect for tense.},

	abstract = {This thesis is a description of So (Thavung), a language in the Vietic branch, MonKhmer subfamily, Austroasiatic family? Currently, So (Thavung) is classified as a Stageseven endangered language on Fishman's Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale (GIDS). The younger So (Thavung) rarely speak their language and the fluent speakers are estimated at 100. The objective of the study was to describe So (Thavung) grammar including phonology and syntax in order to document this small and endangered language. The data was gathered and rechecked from the So (Thavung) at Nong Waeng and Nong Muang villages, Patumwapi subdistrict, Song Dao district, Sakon Nakhon province during the period 2005­-2007. In data analysis, auditory judgment was applied for phonological analysis, together with the PRAAT computer program for the acoustic measurement on registers. Thomas' (1993) tagmemic model, on the other hand, was the main tool adopted for the syntactic analysis of the language.
The phonological findings of the study show that though So (Thavung) is described as having a typical Mon-Khmer register contrast, some pairs of pitch contrast are also found in some casual speech. This may result in So (Thavung) becoming tonal in the future ifthe main feature of voice quality is completely lost. As for the syntax ofthe language, it has been modified and become more like Thai Lao syntax. The typical word order is subject- verbobject. Many Thai-Lao loanwords including grammatical words have been found both in the speech ofthe elderly and young people. In addition, the affixation is not productive anymore. So (Thavung), in conclusion, is considered to be endangered due to its status as a language in transition and the declining number offluent speakers.},

The genetic affiliation of Eibela has not been thoroughly investigated, but it is likely that it belongs to the putative Trans-New Guinea Phylum, of the central and South New Guinea stock. The expression of grammatical relations in Eibela emerges largely as a combination of case- marking, which is largely optional, and constraints based on information structure. Additionally, oblique case markers may function to append clausal constituents to a clause as well as nominal arguments.},

Present-day Great Andamanese (PGA), a koinèized version of the North Great Andamanese languages is a head-marking polysynthetic and agglutinative language with an SOV pattern, and has a very elaborate system for marking inalienability (Abbi 2006, 2010) nested in seven possessive markers designating different body-divisions. These markers are further grammaticalized in the language and appear as proclitics which classify a large number of lexical items as dependent categories. The author proposes that the Great Andamanese conceptualize their world through these interdependencies and hence the grammar of the language encodes this important phenomenon in every grammatical category expressing referential, attributive and predicative meaning. These are very unusual features never reported earlier in grammars of languages of the world and thus, indicate very old structures in the chain of language evolution.},

	abstract = {This dissertation is intended as a contribution to the study and understanding of how language is used among the Akawaio peoples of Guyana, South America. It is a first attempt, limited to one Amerindian village, Waramadong, a community that has not been studied very much. The study begins by analysing four Akawaio speech genres, tareng 'ritual healing chant', mire aburobodi 'praising rhymes for children', pandong 'story', and zegareme'no 'personal narratives', at the levels of both content and grammar. The first entails making anthropological, ethnographical, sociolinguistic and general cultural commentaries on the content and social context within which speech is performed. This is to investigate how the Akawaio speech genres are categorised and classified and in what ways they are performed, interrelated and connected to the wider domain of speaking in Akawaio society. The second is committed to analysing the observed linguistic variation in the speech genres at the levels of both dialectal variation across speakers and stylistic variation across the genres. The analysis takes a multidisciplinary approach, transcending traditional linguistic boundaries, and invoking both social and linguistic theories, especially in the analysis of Akawaio spirituality as a crucial component to understanding the native Akawaio view of speech genres. Thus, this study offers a primary description of a wider, extended view of what is known about language and culture in Akawaio society. This dissertation also seeks to rectify a serious situation, to provide an emphatic counterexample to the common image in linguistics and anthropological literature, where Amerindian communities are treated as largely homogenous groups. The premise behind most anthropological and linguistic studies is that everyone acts and speaks alike within these societies. One aim of this study is to replace this homogenized image of the Amerindian with a richer, more complex and internally diverse picture, of the kind shown here for Waramadong. Appendix B presents a small, but representatively diverse, selection of transcribed, translated, and linguistically annotated texts, representing a small subset of the overall collection of texts recorded for this study.},

	abstract = {This dissertation is primarily a presentation of a grammar of Alamblak, a language of the Sepik River area of Papua New Guinea. The grammar includes phonological and morpho-syntactic components supplemented with a section relating Alamblak to other Middle Sepik languages. There are several significant aspects of Alamblak phonology and morpho-syntax which are given prominence in the grammar. These include discussions of 1) abstractness in phonology, reinterpretation and language change; 2) verb root serialization and its association with processes of incorporating non-verbal roots into the verb stem; 3) the non-discreteness of grammatical levels; 4) the interplay of role and referential structures in the clause; 5) semantico-syntactic features of transitivity; 6) an analysis of the notion of ‘subject’ in Alamblak; and 7) the notion of subordination between clauses and the general correlation of the differentiation of Communicative Dynamism between clauses with the syntactic dependency of one clause upon another. Most of these aspects exhibit a common thesis, that morpho-syntactic form and semantics or pragmatic function are interdependent. Chapter I provides a general introduction to the study in which the general theoretical framework and important theoretical notions are briefly discussed. Included there is a resume of the general features of Alamblak, most of which are implied by its basic SOV word order. The phonology of Alamblak is analysed and described in Chapter II, using a combination of a traditional phonemic approach and a modified Natural Generative approach. The abstractness question is considered there and some completely abstract underlying forms are allowed for alternating morphemes. Discussions concerning historical aspects in the phonology are included where they relate to questions of abstractness, reinterpretation, language change, and the interpretation of a high central vocoid which is epenthetic in some of its manifestations and phonemic in others. Non-verbal word classes are described in Chapter III, and nominal and verbal constructions are discussed in Chapters IV and V, respectively. The notion of grammatical levels is discussed in most detail in Chapter IV, from a Tagmemic viewpoint. There, in the context of the description of the Noun Phrase, the traditional features of stem, word, and phrase levels are applied to the Alamblak levels of stem, phrase-base and phrase. In terms of these traditional definitions, levels in Alamblak are described as structurally7 non-discrete, a feather which is explained in terms of the common functions of constructions at the low levels. The non-discreteness of levels is mentioned again with regard to verbal constructions in Chapter V. Reduplication, compounds, and derivational-like structures (e.g., causatives, benefactives, and reciprocals) are discussed in conjunction with serialized verb stems which are likened to merged clauses. Serialized constructions, which include incorporated non-verbal roots in the verb stem, constitution the major part of the discussion in Chapter V. The basic syntactic structures of independent clauses are described in Chapter VI, followed by a discussion of the semantics of the clause and the interrelationship of syntax and semantics in Chapter VII. Included in the discussion of semantics is a semantic characterization of surface case markers, i.e., role encoding markers, and a description of semantic case roles. Semantic case roles are ultimately associated with verb classes as art of their semantic specification. The discussion of transitivity in the same chapter is the focal point of the interrelationship of syntax and semantics in the clause. In that section twelve verb classes are contrasted along a scale of transitivity; it is there, as a part of the case frame of verb classes, that semantic roles are motivated for Alamblak by correlating semantic features of transitivity with their syntactic reflexes which contrast the different verb classes. Finally, in Chapter VII, the notion of ‘subject’ is analysed in in terms of an interplay of role, referentiality, and perspective. The combinations of clauses in sentence types are described in Chapter VIII. Syntactically􀅒 clauses are related in terms of co-ordination and subordination. The logical relations between clauses are described there and a tendency for old or backgrounded new information to be associated with subordinate clauses is noted. Dependent clauses which are subordinate to an independent clause on the sentence level are distinguished from those which are embedded as a constituent at the same or lower level. These 'embedded' clause types are discussed in Chapter IX, where their syntactic form (including genitive NP's and frequent noun incorporation) and semantic role structure are described. Rules concerning the coreferencing of participants between certain dependent clauses and an independent clause are included in that chapter. In the final chapter, X, we seek to relate Alamblak, as the easternmost language of the Sepik Hill Stock to other Middle Sepik languages. In that chapter a preliminary reconstruction of the Proto-Sepik Hill phonological system is attempted. A number of subgrouping hypotheses are also suggested which historically relate the Sepik Hill languages to each other and to other Middle Sepik languages.},

	abstract = {Ambai is a little-known Austronesian language of Irian Jaya, Indonesia. In this work we discuss the more common elements of the phonology, morphology, and clause-level syntax. This work is basically a synchronic description of the Ambai dialect of the Ambai language, but mention is also made of comparative materials in other Austronesian languages , especially in the morphology section, where they shed light on the Ambai data. We have chosen to limit the scope of this work by not discussing any level higher than the simple sentence or what we will call the expanded clause so as to be able to provide some depth of discussion on those areas covered. Chapter 1 places Ambai in its geographical and linguistic setting as a member of Blust's (1978) South Halmahera - West New Guinea group. The theoretical models used are summarized in 1.2 and the scope and purpose of this study in 1.3. In chapter 2 the sound system of Ambai is described in terms of distinctive features, morpheme-structure rules, and phonological processes. An overview of the basic open and closed word classes is given in chapter 3. We also relate Ambai syntax to syntactic universals as put forth by Greenberg (1966) to provide a concise summary of Ambai word order constraints. Chapter 4 discusses the Ambai noun function-based model which describes the NP as phrase employing a consisting of a referential core modified by Association, Qualification, Quantification, and Orientation elements. The final three chapters of this dissertation employ a layered clause model which sees the clause as consisting of a nuclear predicate, core arguments, and peripheral arguments. The clause nucleus is discussed in chapter 5, along with aspect and directionals which are held to be operators over the clause nucleus. The clause core is considered in chapter 6 where the core arguments (i.e. Subject and Object) are defined. Modality, which expresses the intent or ability of the Actor of the predication to perform the action is discussed as the core-level operator. Chapter 7 completes the discussion of the clause by analyzing the peripheral argument{\textasciitilde} (e.g. GOAL, LOCATION, etc.) and the operators which obtain to the entire clause (i.e. Status, which includes a realis irrealis continuum; Tense; and Illocutionary Force, which involves declarative, interrqgative, and imperative. Appendix A continues the discussion of the verbal Subject affixes presenting diachronic aspects of the problem. Appendix B presents a narrative text in Ambai and Appendix C provides a basic vocabulary list with the Proto-Austronesian roots from which the words are derived. References cited conclude the dissertation.},

	doi = {10.25911/5D763A9A324D8},
	abstract = {This thesis provides the first detailed description of Emmi, a dying language spoken by about two dozen adults who are based at Belyuen on the Cox Peninsula west of Darwin. Chapter One first explains the geographical, historical and social context of the language and its speakers. It describes my fieldwork methodology, and provides an overview of the Emmi language and its typological singularities. It provides a critique of earlier work on the language and summarises what is known about the relationship of Emmi to neighbouring languages. Chapter Two describes the segmental phonology of the language. It provides evidence for the existence of a voicing contrast between stops and the existence of two phonemic fricatives. It shows how the stress patterns of complex morphemes which have been subsumed into the verb reveal that they were once independent words. Chapter Three describes the nominal morphology of the language, with particular reference to the role of adnominal enclitics as NP relators. It explains the function of the generic nouns awa 'meat' and miya 'edible plant, the five ways used to express the possessive relation, and the overlap between adjectives and nouns on the one hand, and adjectives and verbs on the other. Chapter Four explains verb structure, and analyses the morphology of the obligatory components: auxiliary verb, coverbs, bound pronominals, bound number words. Chapter Five examines the possible combinations of auxiliary and coverb and works out the semantic and syntactic motivations for cooccurrence. Chapter Six describes nominal incorporation, distinguishing between lexical and syntactic incorporation and showing how lexically incorporated bodyparts function as metaphors and classifiers for entities v1ith the same shape as the bodypart. Chapter Seven describes the functions of the fourteen propositional enclitics. Chapter Eight describes the syntax of simple and complex clauses with particular focus on serial ronstructions. It shows how the major intransitive auxiliary verbs have been polygrammaticised to provide aspectual information. Appendix A comprises Basedow's word-lists of the language, dating from 1906. Appendix B gives Capell's raw Ami data, dating from the 1950s. Appendix C sets out the auxiliary verb paradigms. Appendix D consists of six texts.},

The first work of its kind to reflect significant advances in linguistics made in recent decades, it offers students, teachers and academics a comprehensive yet user-friendly treatment. The chapters on phonology and morphology make full use of insights from comparative and historical linguistics to elucidate complex systems of roots, stems and endings. The syntax offers linguistically up-to-date descriptions of such topics as case usage, tense and aspect, voice, subordinate clauses, infinitives and participles. An innovative section on textual coherence treats particles and word order and discusses several sample passages in detail, demonstrating new ways of approaching Greek texts. Throughout the book numerous original examples are offered, all with translations and often with clarifying notes. Clearly laid-out tables, helpful cross-references and full indexes make this essential resource accessible to users of all levels},

The goal is to describe the features and processes operating in oral and written discourse. A summary of discourse studies starts with structural linguistics in the 1950s. A sketch of the phonology covers from segments to intonation contours, vowel harmony, consonant harmony, and the future tense morphophonemic process. Grammatically the temporal-reference monitoring system is of typological significance as it is a derived system using verb affix complexes whereas the New Guinea Highlands systems have specific morphemes for this purpose. This system monitors sequential or simultaneous time relations and general or specific anticipatory reference. A unique feature is the double anticipatory reference where two referents of the following clause are specified. The factors relevant to reference monitoring are semantic rather than surface subject. Verbalized constructions have thematic functions. Discourse thematized structures have verbal affixes that agree in tense-mood with the verb of the dominating clause and optionally agree with the subject and object. The eleven verb classes are related to semantic categories. A significant problem is that of defining a grammatical sentence for narratives. The data do not support the establishment of sentences in narratives by grammatical criteria alone. The most relevant factors for describing narrative discourse are interclause relations and intonation rather than grammatical structure. The semantic system is described in terms of features and the propositional framework of Grimes. Reference has both inherent and situational features. Cases have differing inherent prominence according to their mapping relations to clause constituents. Lexical predicates are analyzed in terms of their semantic features, aspect, and case frames. Rhetorical predicates organize discourse and consist of logical, equative, orientation, and response relations. Nontext semantics specifies cultural knowledge needed to understand text content. Cohesive features are phonological, grammatical, and lexical. Intonation divides a text into information units and indicate cohesion between them. Grammatical cohesion includes cross reference and tense-mood agreement, cataphoric reference monitoring, anaphoric affix chains, pronominalization, repetition, and structural parallelism. Lexical cohesive features are items related in a semantic domain, collocation of objects and events or event sequences, and cycles that involve the repetition of sections of text. The staging, or prominence, system indicates the salience of elements in the text. The last element of an intonation contour has prominence and marked prominence occurs when there is more than one contour per clause. Grammatically, structural complexity provides prominence. Open classes and optional elements are more prominent their counterparts. A specificity-complexity continuum varies from 0 affixation to topicalization. Thematization indicates what is being talked about in the clause (local theme) or supraclause (global theme). Unmarked local theme is signalled by the cross reference system. Marked local theme is indicated by complex structures for clause constituents. The cataphoric reference system indicates unmarked global theme whereas marked global theme is signalled by anaphora using structural elements more complex that verb affixes for reference. Oral discourse has fewer prominence features that written, narratives fewer features than nonnarratives, and culturally familiar content fewer features than culturally new content.},

	abstract = {The dissertation is a preliminary grammatical description of the language spoken by the Apinajé, one of the Northern Jê peoples of Central Brazil. It discusses the core facts about Apinajé phonology, morphology and syntax from a functional-typlogical perspective, and provides three appendices: selected maps, a sample collection of texts and a preliminary dictionary. The phonological analysis proposes an alternative interpretation for the inventory of phonemes as comparedto earlier analyses, pointing to phonemic distinctions not previously noted, which might lead to interesting findings regarding the historical development of the language. Apinajmorphemes are typically monosyllabic and the language makes ample use of function words for the expression of grammatical categories, properties that are characteristic of analytic languages. Nonetheless, Apinajé morphology is more complex than it might seem at first, especially with respect to the major lexical categories of the language: Nouns, Verbs and Postpositions. These word classes, especially Nouns and Verbs, are characterized morphologically by the presence of formatives, which are recurrent morphs that are either semantically empty or of elusive meaning, but which subcategorize words in formal or semantic terms. The categories of nonfiniteness, person, and syntactic constituency constitute the core of inflectional morphology, the latter applying to nouns and postpositions, as well as verbs. Verbs are subcategorized morphosyntactically into transitives, intransitives and descriptives, displaying a split intransitivity system with respect to verbal person-marking. Word order is predominantly SOV. Syntactically complex constructions include verb serialization and clause subordination, with ergative case-marking a characteristic of subordinate clauses.},

	abstract = {The Material for the study here presented was collected during a short stay at Marau Sound in 1927, in pursuance of my research work. Bishop Patteson, of the Melanesian Mission, published grammatical notes of the language of Marau Sound at Auckland, New Zealand, about 1860, together with a short catechism, a translation of the Apostles´ Creed and the Lord's Prayer, and a list of words. This material was edited by von der Gabelentz, and was published in his
              Melanesischen Sprachen
              , Leipzig, 1873. I have worked through the material and corrected it where necessary. The two pieces of translation, Creed and Lord's Prayer, which appear in von der Gabelentz. are too faulty to be inserted here as specimens of the language, and I had not the opporetunity of correcting them.
            
            
              Bishop Patteson had several men from Marau Sound with him at Auckland, among whom, according to the information given to me, were Tootoo, Waaro mae, Waihunu, Nini pua, Porike, Porasi (who died at Auckland), and also Vouvete of Kaoka, a village on the mainland near by. The large percentage of San Cristoval wordsand grammatical constructions which appear in Bishop Patteson's material, as quoted by von der Gabelentz, is probably due to the influence of Taroaniara, a San Cristoval man, who acted as guide on the visits to Marau Sound, and whose wife was a Marau Sound woman. Taroaniara was with the party at Auckland, and evidently acted as interpreter. He may even have been commissioned by the Bishop to render certain stock pieces, e.g. the Creed, into the language of Marau Sound. This supposition would account for the presence in the translations of words like
              tahi
              , to live,
              tataro
              (San Cristoval
              dadaro
              ) for “ cross ”, and for such grammatical constructions as
              ia
              , personal article in San Cristoval, instead of a, the Marau Sound usage. Also it would account for the use of
              ni
              , demonstrative article, and
              ia
              , personal pronoun 3rd singular. However, there is good internal evidence that the work in the main was done by the Bishop.},

@phdthesis{courtney_child_1998,

	title = {Child acquisition of {Quechua} morphosyntax},
	abstract = {The goal of this study is to inform child language acquisition theory by accomplishing a description of morphosyntactic development in Quechua speakers between the approximate ages of two and four years. The data analysis yields a description of language acquisition in two major areas: (1) overall development of syntax and of morphology directly relevant to the syntax; (2) development of verb morphology. No attempt is made to support any particular theory of language development. Instead, a number of theoretical perspectives are considered. Fieldwork was carried out in the community of Chalhuanca in the department of Arequipa, Peru, in 1996. The study relies largely on the naturalistic production of six Chalhuancan children between the ages of 2;0 years and 3;9 years. Five children were recorded for five to six hours over a period of four months; the sixth child was recorded for eleven hours over a period of six months. The child corpora, as well as child-directed adult speech, were transcribed by native speakers of Quechua. Also presented is the outcome of an elicitation procedure undertaken with few subjects. The description of overall syntactic development focuses on four topics: (1) the representation of arguments, both analytic and morphological; (2) case- and object-marking; (3) reduplication, ellipsis, and evidential focus; and (4) coordination and subordination. The analysis of the development of verb morphology considers the role of several factors in the acquisition of the verb suffixes: meaning, homophony, phonological aspects, frequency of occurrence, and processing constraints. This description also sheds light on the acquisition of causatives, especially change-of-state verbs, with data presented from naturalistic corpora and the experimental procedure. The analysis favors Strong Continuity: functional projections are available to children before they acquire full productivity of the corresponding morphology. Meaning is foremost in the development of verb morphology, with children seeking unique form-function correspondences. As children begin producing complex verbs, they tend initially to attach a small set of suffixes and their combinations to a wide variety of roots. Finally, the data suggest that children may initially assume that change-of-state verbs are basically transitive.},

	abstract = {This dissertation provides the first general treatment of the grammar of Ika, a Chibchan language of northeastern Colombia. An introductory chapter gives the typological characteristics of Ika, an SOV language, and summarizes phonology and morphophonemics. Following chapters discuss the major word classes, the noun phrase, case marking and postpositional phrases, the verb phrase, basic clause types, sentence formation, subordination, and pragmatics. Several areas of special interest include: split ergativity, with limited ergative patterns in what is essentially a nominative-accusative language; a limited noun class system similar to that of the Athabaskan languages; a verb prefix that enables possessor ascension; zero anaphora and the participant reference system; topic continuity; and optional auxiliary verbs which serve to give clauses a topic-comment structuring. The discussion of subordination includes relative clauses, nominalized clauses, and various types of complementation (e.g., indirect questions and resultant state complements). The chapter on sentence formation outlines the use of clause chaining to combine clauses into sentences, a process common in SOV languages. Some attention is given to the ways in which various grammatical phenomena interact with narrative structure, including, for example, a verb prefix which speakers may use to help specify important locations within a narrative.},

	title = {A grammar of {Hyow}},
	url = {http://hdl.handle.net/10356/73237},
	abstract = {Hyow is an undocumented language, with about four thousand speakers living in the southeast of Bangladesh. This dissertation describes the linguistic features of this undocumented language. This dissertation consists of twelve chapters, a text, a Hyow-English dictionary, three appendices and references. The first chapter of this grammar contains an introductory discussion of the land, life and language of Hyow. An attempt has been made to work out the genetic relation of Hyow with other Kuki-Chin languages in this chapter. The second chapter includes the description of phonetics and phonology, which addresses the vowel and consonant inventory, phonotactics, acoustic analysis, phonological processes and tone sandhi among other topics. The third chapter deals with the word classes found in Hyow. Different formal properties have been used to identify the open and closed word classes in this chapter. The fourth and the fifth chapter are dedicated to a discussion of noun phrase constituents and morphology of nominals, and also address word formation processes. Verbs play an important role in the grammar of Hyow. The sixth chapter focuses on stem alternations and various classes of verbs. The seventh, eighth and ninth chapters concentrate on the morphology of verbs. The tenth chapter includes discussion on grammatical functions and argument indexation on verbs. Case-marking morphology and argument indexation have been utilized to identify the grammatical functions in this chapter. Other than the morphosyntactic coding of core arguments, markings of oblique arguments have also been made in this chapter. Finally, the eleventh and the twelfth chapters deal with structures of simple clauses and complex sentences respectively. The discussion of complex sentences includes adverbial, relative and complement clauses. In addition, discussions have been also done on relative-correlative and comparative-correlative constructions. One text from the corpus has been added as a sample. There is also a bilingual dictionary of about three thousand and one hundred words. The appendices include tokens of acoustic analysis, permitted inflectional categories to the dependent and imperative verbs. At the end of this grammar, a list of references have been given. This is the first attempt of writing a grammar of the language. Out of many interesting linguistic features of Hyow, tone sandhi, verb stem variants and their functions, person hierarchy, middle voice, clausal nominalization and strategies of forming complex clauses are noteworthy. The findings of tone sandhi in Hyow will contribute to understand tone patterns of other undocumented Southern Chin languages. The discussion on stem variants based on their uses in different types of clauses will add to the study of stem alternations in Kuki-Chin languages. The effect of stem alternations on lexical tones might be useful for further study of tonal correspondences among different Kuki-Chin languages. Among the documented Southern Chin languages only Hyow and Asho (Otsuka 2015) show person hierarchy for argument indexations on verbs. This can be useful to determine the lower-level classifications of Kuki-Chin languages. Middle voice plays an important role in the grammar of Hyow. However, this topic has not been widely discussed in other Kuki-Chin languages. The extensive discussion of middle voice in this dissertation will contribute to future studies of middle voice in other Kuki-Chin languages. The use of clausal nominalization again demonstrates how significant it is in Tibeto-Burman languages. To sum up, this dissertation is expected to further the studies of Kuki-Chin languages in the future.},

	abstract = {The Sogeram languages are a family of ten languages spoken in central Madang Province, Papua New Guinea. This dissertation presents a reconstruction of Proto-Sogeram, including sections on its phonology, lexicon, verbal morphology, nominal morphology, and syntax. The methodology employed is, for the most part, the traditional comparative method, especially in the sections focusing on phonology, lexicon, and morphology. But I also argue for methodological innovations to the comparative method, which are grounded in a theoretical understanding of the nature of language and language change. These innovations allow for the reconstruction of syntax, and I reconstruct a good deal of the grammar of Proto-Sogeram. I also discuss many of the various innovations that the Sogeram languages have undergone, and conclude with a grammar sketch of Proto-Sogeram as I reconstruct it.

The dissertation also contains six appendices, each of which is a grammar sketch of a previously undescribed Sogeram language. (Appendix 4 is actually a description of the two closely related Aisi languages.) These are the result of my fieldwork in Madang Province. The data from that fieldwork, along with data from other linguists on the three other Sogeram languages, constitutes the synchronic material on which the reconstruction is based.},

	title = {A {Grammar} of {Awjila} {Berber} ({Libya}) {Based} on {Umberto} {Paradisi}'s {Material}},
	abstract = {The Awjila language is a small Berber language spoken in the Libyan oasis of Awjila. It has several features that make the language different from other Berber languages, such as a phonemic accent, schwa in open syllables and the retention of the Proto-Berber *\_ as v. This thesis consists of three parts: the grammar, the texts and the lexicon. The grammar is the main analytical part of this thesis, but could not exist without the in-depth study of the available Awjila texts and the lexicon. Due to the political situation in Libya, it was not possible to conduct fieldwork on the language. This thesis is therefore based on the published sources on the language. The texts and word list by Umberto Paradisi are the most important of these sources. The grammar contains a lengthy discussion on the interpretation and analysis of the transcription and phonology. This part give us many new insights into the interpretation of many factors of the language. Besides the phonology, the grammar also discusses the morphology of the noun and verb, and the syntax of the language. In the appendix all published Awjila texts have been included, provided with a phonemic transcription and a word-by-word analysis. This analysis is essential for the understanding of the language, and it is referenced extensively in the grammar. The lexicon contains all lexical material available to us on the Awjila language, with a new phonemic analysis of the transcriptions, and a full concordance of all the attestations of the words in its different grammatical forms in the available sources. The lexicon also contains some etymological notes, comparing Awjila to the other Berber languages which will aid future research into the linguistic history of Awjila and other Berber languages},

@phdthesis{allene_grammar_2016,
	type = {doctoral dissertation},
	title = {A {Grammar} of {Kulazngi}},
	abstract = {This dissertation presents an all-embracing grammatical description of Kulazngi, a dialect of Awngi, one of the Central Cushitic languages. It is spoken in the south west of Ethiopia mainly in Jawi woreda in Awi zone in Amhara Regional State and in some kebeles in Dangur Woreda in Benishangul Gumuz Regional State. Kulazngi has 28 consonant (out of which five are labialized) and 6 vowel phonemes. Common morphophonemic processes attested in the language include assimilation, labialization, palatalization, vowel/glide insertion, and vowel elision. A consolidated syllable structure rule is (C)V(C) (C) from which can be drawn six syllable structures as V CV VC CVC VCC CVCC. Kulazngi is a tone language: tone has both lexical and grammatical distinction. Three level (high, mid, low) and one contour (falling), tones are identified in the language. While high and low tones have no positional restriction, mid tone never occurs word initially in polysyllabic words; it does not occur sequentially (as M.M) either. A falling (HL) contour tone occurs as a result of diachronic and synchronic processes. Downdrift and contour formation are among the common tonal processes attested in the language. Nouns appear as masculine or feminine in Kulazngi, or there is no a form representing gender neuter. Thus, there is no a citation form per se. What assumes the citation form is the masculine. All feminine nouns end in a vowel a, while masculine nouns end in vowels i, u, or rarely in e, or in a (labialized) consonant. Whereas the common plural suffix is -ka, Kulazngi shows heterogeneity in plural formation. Derivational and inflectional noun affixes are all suffixes. This study also describes nominal and verbal modifiers. While adjectives are both lexical and derivational, the majority of adverbs are derived from other word classes, mainly from temporal and locative nouns. Kulazngi adjectives show characteristic features of nouns morphologically. Like nouns, they are intrinsically gender marked and are also pluralized in concord with head nouns or, in NPs where head nouns do not overtly appear, alone. However, they are not inflected for case in NPs where they do not assume the head except the accusative case. Pronouns, demonstratives, quantifiers and conjunctions are also described with ample and pertinent illustrative data. III Kulazngi verbs do not stand as a phonological word at root level. They are realized only in discourse suffixing mood, aspect and agreement markers. While consonant-ending verbs at root level constitute the majority, there also exist a number of u-ending and i-ending verbs. Except five verbs which also attach prefixes, all Kulazngi verbs are suffix taking. The majority of Kulazngi verbs are lexical; there also exist a number of verbs derived from nouns and adjectives with transitive derivational morpheme -ts or the intransitive one -t. Kulazngi verbs show complex conjugational pattern based on which they are classified as prefix group, meaning prefix taking (PG), I-group (IG), and T\_group (TG) verbs. IGVs mark 2 and 3F with i and TGVs with t. IGV, and TGV are further subdivided, thus IGV as IGV1, IGV2, and IGV3 and TGV as TGV1, and TGV2. Conjugational complexity of verbs is more exhibited on relativized transitive verbal forms whose direct object is a shared argument in a matrix clause: these verbs, besides aspect markers, appear laden with both subject and object agreement affixes. Kulazngi verbs have valence adjusting mechanisms. Thus the causative and the passive are obtained via derivational morphemes -ts and -(ɨ)st respectively. Middle verbs are either lexical or derived by -t, and reciprocal verbs are formed by derivational morpheme -ŋ. The syntactic description examines the structures and functions of phrasal and clausal constructions. In Kulazngi, phrases are generally head-final. Adjectives in NPs with no overt head nouns assume the head of the NPs. The word order in the language is subject-object-verb (SOV). As the subject is referenced on the verb, a single verbal word may constitute a sentence in sentential constructions with intransitive verb headed VPs},

	abstract = {It was Harold Fleming who first drew the attention of linguists to the Bayso language. Reports concerning the existence of such a people on Gidicho Island in Lake Abaya go back to the beginning of the century and descriptions of various cultural and economic aspects of the life of the Bayso and other inhabitants of Gidicho appeared subsequently; but concerning the language nothing was available until the publication of Fleming's germinal article in 1964. The latter followed a brief period of work on the island with a Bayso speaker. The 216-item vocabulary list and brief indications of the grammar have nevertheless proved tantalizingly suggestive to everyone working on questions of genetic relationships within Cushitic. Alongside the Bayso material the article also presented the first data on the Rendille language of north-east Kenya. Fleming's conclusions that Bayso, Rendille, Boni, and Somali constitute a Macro-Somali group were seen as linguistic support for H. S. Lewis's hypothesis of a south Ethiopian (rather than a northern Horn of Africa) origin for the Somali. Since the initial presentation of these proposals, linguistic research into the Dasenech (Galab), Elmolo, and to a limited extent Arbore, languages has led German linguists to propose an extension of Fleming's Macro-Somali to include these languages. Until very recently the limited nature of the data available on many of the relevant languages had tended to detract from the strength of arguments about their internal relationships. Heine's reports of his recent researches on Rendille, Elmolo, and Boni, as well as his work on the diachrony of the ‘Sam languages’ have done much to advance our knowledge. To date, however, the material available on Bayso has remained restricted to what was presented by Fleming in 1964. The primary purpose of the present paper is to set out the results of research conducted for a period of 17 days during September 1976.},

	title = {Grammatical {Description} and {Documentation} of {Bayso}},
	abstract = {This dissertation deals with the documentation and grammatical description of Bayso/Giddicho, a Lowland East Cushitic language spoken in the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples of Ethiopia. Bayso is an endangered language due to th e strong pressure of the dominant languages spoken in the area, urbanization and population reduction. The documentat ion palt covers video and audio annotation of texts, bilingual word list (Bayso- English) and th e grammatical description. The grammatical description examines Bayso phonology, morphology and syntax based on the primary data that was obta ined via series of fie ldworks and through elicitation, interviews, observation and discussion methods. Therefore, the qualitative research methodology was employed in this disseltation. Bayso, whi ch belongs to Lowland East Cushitic, Omo-Tana subgroup, has 28 consonant phonemes and five vowels with contrastive long vowels. Bayso employs diverse system of noun plural isation which includes suffixa tion, reduplication and final vowel elision. Bayso also marks paucal and singulative on nouns by using di fferent suffixes. Theoretically, a language that marks paucal should also mark dual. However, Bayso is one of few languages that mark paucal without marking dual. Gender polarity is also one of the marked features of Bayso which was one ofthe foc uses ofthis disseltat ion. In Bayso, gender is not marked on nouns. It is refl ected th rough agreement on other word categories such as verb, adjective and demonstrative. The grammatical cases, nominative and accusative, are not morphologically marked. However, the sematic cases such as genitive, dati ve and instrumental are marked with various strategies. In Bayso, noun derivation is not as productive as other related languages. Yet, new nouns can be derived from the existing ones by us ing vari ous suffixes. In Bayso, both verb inflection and deri vation mainly invo lve suffixation. A verb is inflected for tense, person and number to show concord. Verb stems such as causatives, passIves, frequentat ives and inchoati ves are derived by using different derivational suffixes. Word order in Bayso is fl exible. That is modifiers may precede or follow the ir head. However, subordi nate clause always occurs preceding the matrix clause. Bayso employs various mechanisms of sentence chaining, that is, to form coordination, subordinat ion and co nverbs.},

	title = {Provincial {English} {Dialects} and {Barbadian} {English}},
	abstract = {Studies of the non-st and ard Englishes of the Atlantic region have insisted on the English-African contact origin, and subsequent input of English and African languages in the process of the development of these languages. But while the contribution of African languages to the non-st and ard English features of these languages has been emphasized, scholars have minimized or neglected the English contribution. This study seeks to determine the nature of the English language brought to the initial seventeenth century contact situation, and thus the nature of the English input in the developing languages and its contribution to the non-st and ardness of the languages. Focusing on the isl and of Barbados where the impact of English and African languages was greatest, the study traces (1) the origins and language of the Barbados seventeenth century English population; (2) analyzes the social and environmental factors impacting on the contact situation and thus the degree of exposure of the African/black population to the language of the English population; (3) presents some grammatical features shared by Barbadian English and the seventeenth and eighteenth century provincial dialect language of the white population; (4) suggests implications for the analysis of the processes of development of Atlantic non-st and ard English languages. The research establishes that the majority of Englishmen in seventeenth century Barbados spoke non-st and ard provincial English dialects, particularly of southwest Engl and . The nature of the seventeenth century contact of Englishmen and the African/black population facilitated the latter's acquiring the language of the former. The similarities in morphological and other features of the seventeenth century dialects and Barbadian English suggest the early acquisition of these non-st and ard features in Barbadian English. Barbadian English developed under a combination of socio-cultural factors not similarly operative in the other English colonies of Plantation America. This effected a comparatively limited African influence in the eighteenth century creolization process, and the development of a language in which the provincial dialect features brought to the contact situation persist in the language. Seventeenth and eighteenth century provincial English dialects were brought to other isl and s and territories of Plantation America, and their non-st and ardness also impacted on the creolization process of these languages. Creolists should then give greater attention to these dialects in order to analyze more accurately the processes of development of these mixed languages.},

@phdthesis{kenmogne_lexical_2000,
	type = {doctoral dissertation},
	title = {The lexical phonology of {Bakoko}},
	abstract = {This thesis aims at providing a detailed phonological analysis of Bakoko, a narrow Bantu language spoken in Cameroon. The main claim made here is that a stratally organized model of phonology is better suited to deal successfully with the segmental, syllabic and tonal phenomena displayed by the language. More specifically, it is argued that the phonology of Bakoko consists of two non cyclic lexical strata and a postlexical component which can be further subdivided into two strata: postlexical one (P1) and postlexical two (P2). Unlike P2, P1 is a postlexical stratum which is nevertheless sensitive to lexical information. The thesis provides evidence that, prior to the affixation of stratum one formatives, the underived lexical item (root) is scanned by the phonology. Then, the stem (i.e. the root plus extensions or final vowel) and the suffixed tense markers are derived at stratum one. The pre-stem material, that is, the subject marker and the tense markers in the verb forms and the noun class prefixes in the nominal forms, undergo the stratum two rules. These two strata are claimed to be autonomous blocks with their own properties. Boundary tones are postulated for some tenses between the inflectional formatives and the stem. Such tones (when they are high) dock to the right, attracted by the root which is a prominent position.},

	isbn = {978-0-599-42710-5},
	abstract = {This dissertation examines the morphology and syntax of Balanta (Ganja dialect) in light of recent developments in syntactic theory. The picture that emerges is a highly unified one, with clauses and noun phrases having similar structures, and verbal morphology reflecting the hierarchical organization of the syntax. The match between morphological and syntactic structure is not exact, however, as some Balanta inflectional morphology is realized by clitics whose position is phonologically determined. Chapter 1 contains an introduction to Balanta and to the Minimalist Program (Chomsky 1995). Chapters 2 and 3 explore Balanta verb morphology, including the status of grammatical-function-changing affixes, the distribution of subject prefixes, and the properties of verbal clitics. Pronominal clitics are claimed to be of two types, those that are base-generated, and those that reach their surface position via raising and adjunction. Tense and mood clitics, I argue, are phonologically positioned. In chapter 4, I show Balanta to be an asymmetrical object language. I derive differences between ditransitive constructions in symmetrical and asymmetrical object languages from differences in the mapping of arguments to the syntax and the requirement that A-movement be specifier-to-specifier movement, and thus structure-preserving in the strongest sense (Bowers 1993). 1 relate parallels between locative applicatives and English locative inversion to constraints on the checking of subject agreement features. I address the noun phrase in chapters 5--7. Balanta genitive pronouns and genitive phrases have different distributional properties. I argue that this results from their being generated in different positions and to the proposal that genitive case licensing involves multiple-feature-checking. An unusual morphological distinction between adjectives modifying events and those modifying individuals is shown to support Larson's (1995, 1998) theory of event modification. In chapter 8, I present two focus constructions. The analysis reinforces parallels noted between CP and DP in previous chapters, as well as between wh-formation and focus. I have included four appendices: Appendix 1 is an overview of Balanta's noun class system; Appendix 2 contains three texts; Appendix 3 is a Balanta-English lexicon; and Appendix 4 is a comprehensive bibliography of work on the Atlantic family.},
